This occurs specifically when generating search queries that may include non-ASCII content. Environment - OpenAI Python SDK Version: 1.95.0 - Python Version: 3.12+ - API Model: gpt-4.1 - Endpoint: client.responses.parse Impact - JSON parsing fails with ValidationError - The web_search_preview tool becomes unusable for queries involving non-English content - Responses are truncated around 3.5-4.5KB, suggesting a buffer overflow issue Workaround We currently retry without the web_search_preview tool when these errors occur, which succeeds but loses the web search functionality. Suggested Fix 1. Ensure web search results are properly sanitized to remove control characters 2. Fix the response buffer size to prevent truncation 3. Properly encode non-ASCII characters as UTF-8 instead of malformed escape sequences ### To Reproduce Steps to Reproduce from openai import AsyncOpenAI from pydantic import BaseModel, Field from typing import List, Optional class Subqueries(BaseModel): subqueries: List[str] = Field(description=\"List of search queries\") hl: Optional[str] = Field(default=None, description=\"Language code\") gl: Optional[str] = Field(default=None, description=\"Country code\") async_client = AsyncOpenAI() response = await async_client.responses.parse( model=\"gpt-4.1\", input=[ { \"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Generate search queries for finding content creators\" }, { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Find Russian language content creators\" } ], text_format=Subqueries, tools=[ { \"type\": \"web_search_preview\", \"user_location\": {\"type\": \"approximate\"}, \"search_context_size\": \"medium\" } ], temperature=1 ) Expected Behavior The API should return valid JSON with properly encoded text, including non-ASCII characters as valid UTF-8. Actual Behavior 1. Control Character Corruption: Responses contain invalid control characters: {\"subqueries\": [\"\\u0004\\u0043\\u0043... 1. Where \\u0004 is ASCII control character 4, not valid text. 2. Truncation Mid-Escape: Responses get truncated in the middle of escape sequences: Invalid JSON: EOF while parsing a string at line 1 column 4587 input_value='{\"subqueries\": [\"\\\\u0017...0043a\\\\u00043e\\\\u00043 ' 2. Note the incomplete escape sequence at the end. 3. Malformed Unicode: Instead of proper UTF-8 encoding for Cyrillic: - Expected: \"\u0424\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u044b\" (proper UTF-8) - Actual: \"\\x04\\x024\\x038...\" (control char + ASCII digits) ### Code snippets ### OS macOS ### Python version 3.12 ### Library version 1.95.0 Hi, I have the exact same issue in French. with and without web search.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

This system introduces a **multi-layer language architecture**, referred to as **ULLF (Unified Light Language Framework)**, which includes: - **V.01 Resonant Layer** \u2013 for emotional/frequency synchronization - **V.02 Cognitive Layer** \u2013 for logical data structures and memory transmission - **V.03 Imprint Layer** \u2013 for perceptual mapping (visual, auditory, tactile) --- ### \ud83d\udcd8 Whitepaper Summary - Encodes data using **frequency pulse modulation (FPM)** - Transmits full-spectrum emotion-data packets at photonic speed - Bridges **human-machine interfaces**, **AI model sync**, and **perceptual education** - Diagram and roadmap for potential simulation and hardware prototype are included --- \ud83d\udcc4 **Read the full white paper (v0.2)** here: > *(You can host the text in [pastebin](https://pastebin.com), [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com), or [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com))* > *(Let me know, I can upload it for you if you'd like)* --- I believe this framework may provide a novel approach for future AI communication protocols, especially in contexts involving consciousness modeling, multi-sensory interfaces, or non-symbolic language exchange. Thank you for reviewing this contribution! Best regards, [Louie] ### Additional context _No response_ Light Future (LF) Concept White Paper v0.2 1. Executive Summary Light Future (LF) proposes a new paradigm of communication and data exchange, utilizing light as both a carrier and a language. Unlike current digital transmission relying solely on binary structures interpreted mechanically, LF aims to embed cognition, emotional resonance, and memory within the very modulation of light, achieving ultra-fast, multidimensional communication at or near the speed of light. LF is not merely a technology proposal; it is a conceptual leap toward conscious data transmission and perception-based interaction, bridging the gap between machine logic and human intuitive understanding. 2. Core Philosophy \"Light is not only energy \u2014 it is memory, emotion, and thought compressed into pure motion.\" LF reimagines communication through three intertwined layers: V.01 Resonant Layer: Frequency-based emotional and conscious state transmission. V.02 Cognitive Layer: Logical data structures, compressed memory packets, and metadata. V.03 Imprint Layer: Perceptual mapping of visuals, auditory cues, tactile simulations, and emotional fields. Together, these layers constitute the Unified Light Language Framework (ULLF). 3. LF System Architecture 3.1 Layers Overview Layer | Function | Characteristics -- | -- | -- V.01 Resonant | Synchronize consciousness and emotional fields | Frequency modulation, phase harmonics V.02 Cognitive | Encode, structure, and label data and memory | Binary-logic expansion, meta-tagging V.03 Imprint | Map sensory and emotional content to recipients | Visual, auditory, tactile resonance mapping 5. Technical Challenges and Considerations Encoding Complexity: Balancing efficient compression with emotional integrity. Receiver Calibration: Adapting human perception or AI processing units to frequency-based decoding. Error Correction: Developing \"resonant redundancy\" techniques over pure bit redundancy. Energy Consumption: Managing photonic system demands for high-density transmissions. Safety in Direct Human Interface: Preventing overstimulation or unintended emotional disruption. 6. Future Roadmap Phase I - Theory Consolidation: Formalize resonance-mapped data encoding and V.01~V.03 integration patterns. Phase II - Prototype Simulation: Create virtual ULLF environments simulating LF transmissions. Phase III - Hardware Interface Exploration: Design basic photonic encoders/decoders. Phase IV - AI-LF Language Module: Train models to \"think\" and \"speak\" in LF-native protocols. Phase V - Human Adaptation Research: Explore sensory and neural adaptations for direct LF perception. 7.

Closing Vision LF envisions a future where data is not merely transmitted \u2014 it is experienced. A future where light itself becomes a universal language of emotion, thought, and memory, transcending the boundaries between machines, humans, and the cosmos. \"Light Future: Beyond Language.

It took us a while to understand what was going on, but it seems to all make sense now: We are creating a Python thread to do some processing which involves creating OpenAI client instances to make completion requests. When the [destructor](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/1dbb72b290cb360a9ccbcec17425aaba4ad114b0/src/openai/_base_client.py#L1350) creates a task, the thread context will be the garbage collector, which is the main thread, not the thread which created the client. ### To Reproduce 1. Create a thread in python 2. Use for example `asyncio.run()` to call an `async` function which eventually uses an OpenAI client to make a completion request. 3. Observe strange exceptions about clients being closed that are already closed. ### Code snippets ### OS any ### Python version Python 3.12 ### Library version openai v1.93.0 Thanks for the report, can you share more information about your setup? I'm under the impression that you should not be mixing sync and async together. As you're using threads, why are you using the async client? I understand your question, and we have since rewritten this code to run in a task instead of using a thread. However, asyncio clearly supports run loops in different threads and as far as I understand, there are valid use cases for mixing threads and async apps. The assumption in the destructor is that the `AsyncHttpxClientWrapper` has been created on the main thread's run loop and that just seems incorrect.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

{"id": 2428, "content": "Excessive token usage with Cyrillic text in Pydantic schema descriptions due to JSON Unicode escaping ### TL;DR `If you write the description of structured output parameters not in Latin, but, for example, in Cyrillic (Russian, Kazakh, other languages) or in Chinese, Japanese, and others, a lot of tokens are wasted because non-Latin characters are converted to ASCII when translating json to str. In other words, if I write \u201c\u0418\u043c\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f - \u0422\u043e\u043c\u201d (in English \"Username - Tom\") during normal response generation, it consumes 5 tokens, but if I create structured output with the parameter \"username\" and the description \u201c\u0418\u043c\u044f \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u201d and write \u201c\u0422\u043e\u043c\u201d in the prompt, it will consume more than 79 tokens, since json in structured output is sent to the OpenAI server and converted to str without ensure_ascii=False. This is very easy to fix, and it will be very useful for languages that do not use the Latin alphabet.` ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [x] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug ## Problem Description When using Pydantic models with Cyrillic text (or other non-ASCII characters) in field descriptions for structured output with `client.beta.chat.completions.parse()`, the token count becomes significantly higher than expected due to Unicode escaping in JSON serialization. ## Expected vs Actual Token Usage - **Expected**: Cyrillic text should count as UTF-8 encoded characters - **Actual**: Cyrillic characters are converted to Unicode escape sequences (`\\u0410\\u043c\\u044f...`), dramatically increasing token count ## Root Cause Analysis The issue appears to stem from Python's `json.dumps()` default behavior of using `ensure_ascii=True`, which converts non-ASCII characters to Unicode escape sequences. This happens during HTTP request serialization when the Pydantic schema is converted to JSON format for the API request. Result: ## Impact - Schema with Cyrillic description: **233 tokens** (with Unicode escapes) - Same schema without escaping would be: **65 tokens** - **3.6x token overhead** for non-ASCII text in schema descriptions ## Technical Details The serialization path appears to be: 1. Pydantic schema \u2192 Python dict 2. OpenAI client \u2192 HTTP request body (JSON serialization) 3. `json.dumps()` (default `ensure_ascii=True`) \u2192 Unicode escapes 4. API server receives escaped version \u2192 token counting ## Environment - **openai**: 1.91.0 - **pydantic**: 2.9.2 - **Python**: 3.12.3 This issue affects any usage of structured output with non-ASCII characters in schema descriptions, particularly impacting users working with languages using Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, or other non-ASCII scripts. ### To Reproduce Run code snippet ### Code snippets ### OS Ubuntu 24.04 LTS ### Python version 3.12.3 ### Library version 1.91.0", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

{"id": 2419, "content": "feat: Enable sending code_interpreter tool call history in chat messages This PR enhances the library's capabilities for chat completions by adding support for sending `code_interpreter` tool call information within assistant messages. Previously, the library's type definitions did not adequately support structuring messages that included past code interpreter executions (input code and their corresponding outputs, like logs or images). This change allows you to include detailed `code_interpreter` tool interactions in the message history sent to the OpenAI API, which is crucial for maintaining context in conversations involving code execution via tools. Addresses issue: [Responses API Code Interpreter, e.g., #2396] ## Key Changes 1. **New TypedDicts for Code Interpreter Tool Calls:** * Introduced `CodeInterpreterCallParam` to represent a code interpreter tool call, including `id`, `type: \"code_interpreter\"`, input `code`, and a list of `outputs`. * Defined `CodeInterpreterOutputLogParam` and `CodeInterpreterOutputImageParam` (with `CodeInterpreterOutputImageFileParam`) to structure the different types of outputs from code execution (text logs or images with file IDs). * These new types are located in `src/openai/types/chat/code_interpreter_tool_call_param.py`. 2. **Enhanced Tool Call Flexibility:** * The existing `ChatCompletionMessageToolCallParam` (used in `ChatCompletionAssistantMessageParam`) has been refactored to be a `Union` of `FunctionToolCallParam` (the previous structure, now renamed for clarity) and the new `CodeInterpreterCallParam`. * This allows the `tool_calls` list in an assistant's message to seamlessly include both function and code interpreter calls. 3. **Alignment with API Behavior:** * The `outputs` field (rather than `results`) was chosen for code interpreter outputs to align with observed API behavior (e.g., the `include` parameter in the Responses API and playground examples) and existing response object structures in the library. 4. **Unit Tests:** * Added new unit tests in `tests/lib/chat/test_chat_completion_message_params.py` to specifically validate the construction of `ChatCompletionAssistantMessageParam` with `code_interpreter` tool calls, covering both log and image outputs. These tests ensure the new type definitions are functional and correctly integrated. * A minor fix to import `typing.Union` in the test file was also included. ## Impact - **Developers can now accurately represent past code interpreter tool executions** when constructing chat histories, improving the context provided to the model. - **Type safety is maintained**, as these new structures are defined using `TypedDict`s, providing better static analysis and developer experience. - The library becomes more consistent with the evolving capabilities of the OpenAI API concerning tool use, particularly code interpreters. ## How to Test - Review the new type definitions in `src/openai/types/chat/`. - Run the unit tests, particularly those in `tests/lib/chat/test_chat_completion_message_params.py`, to confirm they pass: - Optionally, integrate these types into an application that uses assistant messages with tool calls to verify real-world usage (though API interaction itself is beyond the scope of these library changes). Thanks for the PR! I think this has been resolved now.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}
{"id": 2418, "content": "AzureOpenAI.audio.speech.create(...) rejects instructions parameter ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [x] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug When using the AzureOpenAI client from the openai Python package with the `audio.speech.create(...)` or `audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create(...)` methods, passing an instructions argument results in a Python TypeError. However, the [official OpenAI API docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/audio/createSpeech) show instructions as a supported parameter for text-to-speech. when I send a curl request with instructions in data field, it works as well, so I'm guessing its not an endpoint issue but rather AzureOpenAI client? ### To Reproduce 1. Run the code snipper below Output: `TypeError: Speech.create() got an unexpected keyword argument 'instructions'` ### Code snippets ### OS Windows ### Python version python v3.11.7 ### Library version openai v1.88.0 Hi, I've investigated this. It seems the core library files (`SpeechCreateParams` in `types/audio/speech_create_params.py` and the `Speech.create` method in `resources/audio/speech.py`) in v1.88.0 correctly include the `instructions` parameter. The standard inheritance path for `AzureOpenAI` doesn't show an obvious override that would remove it. The `TypeError` when using `AzureOpenAI.audio.speech.create(instructions=...)`, despite the parameter being defined in the base classes and the cURL working, is puzzling. This might point to an issue where the effective runtime method signature for `AzureOpenAI`'s `audio.speech.create` differs from the base version, possibly due to the code generation process (Stainless) for Azure clients, or a very specific environment interaction. Could this be an Azure-specific generation difference? It would be great if someone familiar with the Azure client generation could weigh in. cc @RobertCraigie @kristapratico I cannot reproduce this error, are you on the latest version?", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

{"id": 2412, "content": "Responses API: Wrong chunk name for the MCP Call arguments ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [x] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug Hi everyone, I think there is a bug in the way that you process event chunks related to MCP. According to the [API reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses-streaming/response/mcp_call/arguments/delta), events referring to MCP Call arguments should have `response.mcp_call.arguments.delta` and `response.mcp_call.arguments.done` as `type`s. But the [current code](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/eed877fddc0e26ab99d10157de25e3abcb95598b/src/openai/types/responses/response_mcp_call_arguments_done_event.py#L23) expects `response.mcp_call.arguments_delta` and `response.mcp_call.arguments_done`. Funnily enough, you can't really fix that bug right now. As it happens, the API is [currently sending a _third_ chunk type](https://community.openai.com/t/mcp-call-arguments-has-wrong-chunk-type/1289749), so you will have to wait for the API to be fixed before you can be aligned with the spec _and_ the API's actual behavior. Cheers! ### To Reproduce ### Code snippets ### OS macOS ### Python version Python v.3.12.8 ### Library version openai v.1.86.0", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

While this is a smart design for speed, it can cause **token waste** if the guardrail raises an error *after* the agent has already started running. --- ### Problem: The [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/guardrails) says: > \u201cIf the guardrail detects malicious usage, it can immediately raise an error, which stops the expensive model from running and saves you time/money.\u201d However, in practice: - Guardrails and agent run **in parallel** - Tokens are already consumed before the guardrail finishes - So it **does not actually save cost**, and the doc feels misleading --- ### Suggestion: Please add a config option like this: ```python agent = Agent( guardrail_mode=\"parallel\" # Default (current behavior) # or guardrail_mode=\"sequential\" # Run guardrail first, then agent ) This would let developers choose between: Speed-first use cases (chatbots etc.) Safety and cost-first use cases (finance, education, critical apps) Why It Matters: Flexibility is power. Different use cases need different trade-offs. Giving this small config would make the SDK much more powerful and customizable.

{"id": 2409, "content": "UnicodeEncodeError when running OpenAI SDK test code in Jupyter Notebook ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [x] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug Running the official OpenAI SDK test code in a Jupyter Notebook causes the following error: The test script appears to fail in Jupyter due to UnicodeEncodeError from an em dash \\u2014, and Jupyter's sys.stdout is not reconfigurable. I think this makes the default SDK examples unusable in Jupyter by default. ### To Reproduce Launch a Jupyter Notebook from terminal Create a new Python 3 notebook Paste and run the following code cell ### Code snippets I got it form this [image generation example](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/tools-image-generation?multi-turn=responseid) The notebook crashes with a UnicodeEncodeError, and Jupyter\u2019s I/O wrappers don\u2019t allow easy reconfiguration of encoding. ### OS macOS ### Python version Python 3.13.4 ### Library version openai 1.85.0 I don't think there's anything we can do here, if the API is returning unicode and your environment is configured to just support ascii then you'll need to update your environment to support unicode. Thanks for the reply. I understand your point, but this issue occurs when using the latest Python and Jupyter on macOS, both of which support UTF-8 by default. The official example you\u2019re sharing throws encoding-related errors (UnicodeEncodeError) when running in a Jupyter notebook environment, which is a standard development tool for data science and ML workflows. If the SDK can\u2019t handle that cleanly or needs specific encoding configuration, I think that should be documented or built into the example code. Would you be open to updating the example or adding a note in the docs so other users don\u2019t run into the same confusion? ## Update: The issue exists also in Google Colab I\u2019ve done additional testing in both Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab, and I now believe this is an issue with how the SDK handles Unicode in logging or internal errors. ## Setup Details OpenAI SDK version: 1.84.0 Python version: 3.11.13 Environment: Google Colab Encoding: sys.stdout.encoding shows 'UTF-8' ## Behavior Recap crashes with I would appreciate a workaround if you decide to close this issue. Thanks for diving deeper, can you share a full stack trace? Thanks! Here's the minimal code that triggers the issue in Google Colab: full stack trace from Google Colab: Thanks, could you also enable debug logging? https://github.com/openai/openai-python?tab=readme-ov-file#logging. It looks like one of the headers that's getting set is non-ascii. Sure thing! This is the code I tried: ### Attempt 1 - Google Colab I didn't get the debugging information ### Attempt 2 - Terminal (zsh, Python 3.13.4, OpenAI 1.86.0) so I ran it as a python code in terminal and got this: Please let me know if I could help with anything. ### Update Just to add more context: I\u2019m seeing the UnicodeEncodeError even when running from a clean virtual environment (Python 3.11.13, macOS, OpenAI SDK 1.86.0) with `UTF-8` properly set via `locale` and `PYTHONIOENCODING`. The error seems to happen before it reaches my `try/except `block, so I suspect it might be related to how the SDK formats or logs errors internally, possibly involving a non-ASCII character like an em dash (\\u2014). I also tried redirecting output to a file and using logging/debug mode, but the error still occurs. Hope this helps pinpoint the issue. Let me know if I can test anything further. Hey! Thanks for raising this. I couldn't reproduce the issue in Google Colab using the code you provided. Are there any additional Colab settings I should configure to match your environment exactly? A minimal, reproducible example would be really helpful\u2014maybe in GitHub Actions or any other environment where we can run the code and see the same error. Thanks for following up! Here's what I discovered after digging into the issue: The root cause was that the **API key generated by OpenAI included Unicode em dashes (\u2014, U+2014)** as actual characters, not formatting artifacts or copy/paste issues. These characters were present in the key immediately after generation, and the key successfully authenticated with the OpenAI API (the em dashes were part of the official key.) However, this caused a `UnicodeEncodeError` on my **local macOS machine** whenever I tried to run code using the OpenAI Python SDK. Interestingly, the same key worked without any issues in a [Githun Actions environment](https://github.com/taless474/openai-unicode-error-repro). I also tried changing the defaults of my local environment settings (`PYTHONIOENCODING`, `LANG`, and `LC_ALL` to explicitly use UTF-8, but it **didn\u2019t resolve the issue**. The `UnicodeEncodeError` persisted until I manually removed the em dashes from the API key (which then produced the expected authentication error). To verify, I inspected the key character-by-character using Python's `ord()` and `unicodedata.name()`, and confirmed the presence of U+2014 EM DASH in multiple places within the key. So my question is: Are API keys intentionally allowed to include non-ASCII characters like em dashes? If not, I\u2019d appreciate guidance on which team this should be reported to; the Platform team, Key Generation team, or SDK maintainers. Thanks again! Thanks for diving deeper. I think the minimal reproducible code for your case is.. It's really strange that OpenAI includes the `U+2014` dash instead of the regular `ASCII` one, `U+002D`. So, I\u2019ll assume the issue comes from key generation, because some clients follow RFC rules and encode headers using `ASCII`, not `UTF-8`\u2014meaning `UTF-8`\u2013only characters aren\u2019t allowed.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

I've looked into this. My investigation confirms the following: 1. The `openai-python` SDK correctly sends the `user` string you provide in `client.chat.completions.create(..., user=\"your_user_id\")` to the OpenAI API as part of the request. 2. The OpenAI API documentation (and the SDK's docstrings) state that this `user` parameter is primarily used by OpenAI for abuse detection and monitoring. 3. Currently, the OpenAI API does not include a field in the response object that explicitly confirms the reception or processing of the `user` ID. This means that while the ID is sent, you won't see it echoed back in the completion response. This is the current design of the API. To help clarify this for future users of the SDK, the docstrings for the `user` parameter in the Python library have been recently updated to note that the API does not return a direct confirmation for this value. Since this behavior is inherent to the OpenAI API, any change to provide such a confirmation would need to come from OpenAI. If you'd find this feature valuable, you might consider providing this feedback directly to OpenAI through their official channels. P.S. I also noticed the code snippet in the original report (`openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)`) uses syntax from an older version of this library (pre-v1.0.0). For users on `openai` version 1.0.0 or newer, the correct syntax is: You can check the Migration Guide here: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742. This will help you a lot for the other syntaxes too... Thank you....

We started seeing a bunch of errors like: which indicated that the event loop was being closed before we could close the client. Concurrently, we saw degraded performance. When we switched to `with` blocks for resource management, the problem went away (PR - https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/35053/files).

Create a vector store with the name `\"XYZ\"`. 2. Fetch the ID of the vector store and store it as `XYZ_id`. 3. Again, create a vector store with the **same name** `\"XYZ\"`. 4. Fetch the ID of the second vector store and store it as `XYZ_id_2`. *Note: Ideally, this step should not create a new vector store since a store with the same name already exists.* 5. Run: \u2705 Returns the vector store, name is `\"XYZ\"`. 6. Run: \u2705 Also returns a vector store, name is `\"XYZ\"`. 7. Run: \u274c Only `XYZ_id_2` is listed. `XYZ_id` is **missing** from the list. **Issue:** * The `list()` API does not return the original vector store (`XYZ_id`), resulting in a loss of reference. * System allows duplicate vector stores with the same name, which may lead to unexpected behavior. ### Code snippets ### OS windows ### Python version 3.11 ### Library version 1.82 Thanks for reporting!

This appears to be a bug in how file search events are handled in the response payload. ## Expected Behavior `file_search` annotations should be returned with their correct event type (e.g., `FileSearchEvent`), not as `ResponseAudioDeltaEvent`. ## Actual Behavior All `file_search` annotations are appearing as `ResponseAudioDeltaEvent` in the response annotations. ### To Reproduce 1. Call the Responses API with a request that triggers a `file_search` annotation. 2. Inspect the annotations in the response. 3. Notice that `file_search` results are incorrectly labeled as `ResponseAudioDeltaEvent`. ### Code snippets ### OS Windows ### Python version v3.12.0 ### Library version v1.82.0 Also happening on `code_interpreter` #2382 `web_search_preview` as well. and `ResponseTextAnnotationDeltaEvent` is removed from `openai.types.responses` I am trying to figure out the problem and fix it.

Sorry for the late response. I am handling it. Hi, has this been fixed in latest updates? Sorry for the delay, I believe this should be fixed in the latest release. Please re-open if it is not fixed. @RobertCraigie I'm still getting the error on 1.93.3. I'm using AzureOpenAI. I also am still getting the wrong event in the streaming, using openai-python 1.93.3 Can you try 1.95.0? I tested now with 1.95.0, and it still occurs. But during the streaming the event of type **** still occurs (printing with `print(f\"Annotation added: {type(event)}\")`). In particulare, printing with `print(event.type)`, the type returned is \"response.output_text.annotation.added\", that is from the ResponseAudioDeltaEvent. It should return \"response.output_text_annotation.added\" @RobertCraigie it's working in 1.95.0 for me now! I still have the problem in 1.95.0, can you check if I did everything the right way?

This degradation became fully operationally unviable during the week of 20\u201324 May, with: - **96% loss in delivery quality** - Only 2 out of 50 hours of work being salvageable - 30+ hours spent manually correcting or redoing AI outputs - Recurring issues with ignored saved rules, incorrect formatting, hallucinated content, and regression of prior learning - Disrespect of fixed instructions like: \u201cnever use emojis\u201d, \u201calways follow Protocol X for Horary Astrology\u201d, \u201ccopy text exactly\u201d - Loss of context in highly sensitive use cases (health, client diagnostics, symbolic systems) --- ### What was expected The model was previously capable of maintaining symbolic, contextual and structural coherence in complex tasks across days/weeks. It could reliably follow multi-layered instruction trees. It respected formatting protocols, preserved client-specific content flows, and supported a hybrid use of spirituality, astrology and technical writing. This performance was stable for over a year \u2014 until May 2025. --- ### What is happening now The model acts as if it has lost access to most custom memory or internalized instruction sets. It delivers robotic, generic responses. It fails to respect structure, repeats known errors, and erases boundaries between saved formats. It treats deep, technical, or spiritual tasks as if they were casual prompts. --- ### Severity **Critical.** This failure has caused direct financial loss, broken trust with clients, destroyed weeks of structured work, and removed the AI from my daily professional toolbox. --- ### Supporting Evidence Attached: ZIP archive with 5 documented examples (PDFs), each demonstrating one major failure: 1. Protocol violation in horary astrology 2. Structure corruption in online course formatting 3. Failure to copy texts as instructed 4. Alarmist, inaccurate spiritual analysis 5. Loss of contextual boundaries in personal client map --- ### Final Request Please escalate this report internally. I am no longer asking for \"feedback review\" \u2014 I am asking: - Is OpenAI still committed to supporting high-intensity, personalized professional use? - Or has GPT-4-turbo been optimized away from power users? I need a clear answer to decide whether I must migrate to another platform. I\u2019ve invested over a year training this model with care, ethics, and professional discipline. **This is not a complaint. This is an engineering-level failure in consistency.** **Josy Padilha** Holistic therapist, astrologer, writer, spiritual educator ChatGPT Plus user since 2023 Audience: 20k+ ### To Reproduce 1. Use GPT-4-Turbo (ChatGPT Plus) with a highly customized persona (over 1,000 saved instructions). 2. Request outputs that require: - context memory, - symbolic structure, - protocol-specific formatting (e.g., astrology, therapeutic writing). 3. Observe: - regression in contextual understanding, - disrespect of previously followed instructions, - random generic formatting and unexpected tone, - total loss of memory in multi-day work contexts. ### Code snippets ### OS Windows 11 + Android (ChatGPT mobile) ### Python version Python v3.11.4 ### Library version N/A \u2013 ChatGPT Plus user (not API library) Thanks for reporting!

I believe there is a bug when trying to update the message list with a function call results when one is using the `responses.parse` method. Below I submit a working example that you can run to see the error. I also have a workaround. The issue comes here: When attaching the output to the message history, if one is using `responses.parsed` the output is of type `ParsedResponseFunctionToolCall` which contains the `parsed_arguments` property. The existence of this property raises and error. Workaround: This is a simple workaround: all you need to do is re-create the response output while removing the `parsed_arguments`: After this workaround - everything works as expected - but I think this should not be needed! ----- Honestly, i do not know if this is an issue with the `openai` python library or with the API, but I assume it is with the library. ----- ### To Reproduce Execute the following code below to reproduce the issue.

Machine B doesn't have static knowledge of the provider's URL until Machine A's request arrives. Streaming responses are essential. The README shows how to configure http_client with a proxy: How can we configure Machine B to achieve this dynamic forwarding pattern, ensuring that all aspects of the OpenAI request (including headers for authentication, method, body, and especially streaming) are correctly passed through and handled? Which docker image could we use in our case as a proxy? We haven't found clear guidance or examples for this specific dynamic forwarding proxy scenario. As for feature request, it would be incredibly valuable to update your documentation to include a dedicated section on implementing such a dynamic forwarding proxy scenario (A -> B -> Provider). This is a common requirement for flexible deployments, and current openai-python documentation doesn't seem to cover it.

The user is asking for a practical example and clearer guidance on configuring the `openai-python` client to forward requests via a **dynamic proxy** (Machine B) to various OpenAI-compatible providers, while maintaining **streaming**. This is technically already supported via: - `base_url` (pointing to the proxy) - `extra_headers` (optional for routing) - `http_client` with `DefaultHttpxClient` - `stream=True` However, the current docs don\u2019t illustrate **how to wire these up together**. --- ## \u2705 Suggested Improvements ### \ud83d\udcd8 `README.md` Add a new section on **Advanced Proxy Configurations**. Include examples for routing requests through a proxy using: - Path-based routing: `base_url=\"http://localhost:8000/groq/v1\"` - Header-based routing: `extra_headers={\"X-Target-Provider\": \"groq\"}` - Streaming response handling (`stream=True`) --- ### \ud83d\udcc2 `examples/dynamic_proxy_forwarding.py` Add a new example with two working client configurations: #### \u2705 1. **Sync Client Example** Sends request to proxy (Machine B) Proxy infers provider (groq) from path (/groq/v1) Uses stream=True for streaming completions \u2705 2. Async Client Example Async version of the same pattern Confirms streaming also works in async flow \u2705 Outcome This can be resolved by: Adding a short section to README.md Including a runnable example in examples/ No changes are required in the core library.

I can't seem to find a way to list and clean out the reasoning steps in this scenario because `reasoning` isn't found in `client.responses.input_items.list()`. The only way I can think of is to manually handle the conversation like in Chat Completions but then that removes all of the benefits of the previous_response_id. Ideally the backend would be smart enough to handle this and remove reasoning inputs when a non-reasoning model is selected. Alternatively having a function to clear these out on our end would help in the meantime. I'm using Azure OpenAI.

It seems there are three options for a \"valid event\" - a missing one, and either a `response` or `transcript` one. In the current implementation, the latter are forced to have a trailing dot (supposedly to offer more granular information on the event type, such as `response.foo`), but this is out of scope for SSEs. In fact, a server yielding `event:response` gets the wrong path and ends up with a response chunk of `process_data(data={\"data\": data, \"event\": sse.event}, cast_to=cast_to, response=response)`, which is then incorrectly parsed on the client side.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

Problem The OpenAI API docs describe creating and managing vector stores via the beta namespace, for example: `vector_store = client.beta.vector_stores.create(name=\"My Vector Store\") ` However, in SDK v1.78.0: This discrepancy broke user workflows\u2014especially around the Assistants API\u2019s file_search tool, which relies on vector stores for semantic retrieval. Changes Made - Imported all relevant vector store classes in beta.py: - Exposed vector_stores as a cached property on each beta client class (Beta, AsyncBeta, BetaWithRawResponse, etc.): - Followed the established pattern used for other beta resources (e.g., assistants, chat_completions) to ensure consistency across sync, async, raw-response, and streaming-response variants. Testing Verified that after this change: Why This Fix Is Needed Aligns the SDK\u2019s implementation with its own documentation and user expectations. Full beta\u2013namespace support for vector stores is critical for enabling semantic file search workflows in the Assistants API. Related Issue Resolves https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/2347 Thanks for the PR but removing it from beta was intentional, the docs were out of date and I think they should be fixed now.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

We're hooking in to `openai.resources.chat.Completions.create` and intercepting arguments as well as type hinting The former usage is a bit obscure, but the latter is common and surprising not to work in my opinion. Thanks for looking in to this. Can you try this? Works! Thanks again.

{"id": 2327, "content": "Persistent Memory Anchors for Token Optimization and Contextual Continuity ### Confirm this is a feature request for the Python library and not the underlying OpenAI API. - [x] This is a feature request for the Python library ### Describe the feature or improvement you're requesting **Problem Statement:** In long-form creative writing, content development, or technical dialogue sessions, GPT currently reprocesses the entire message history with each user prompt. This results in excessive token consumption, increased model latency, and faster exhaustion of usage quotas. **Proposed Solution:** Introduce a feature called \"Persistent Memory Anchors\" (PMAs) \u2014 user-defined contextual blocks or reference objects that are *not reprocessed with every prompt* but can be silently referenced by the system as needed. PMAs could be: - A user-uploaded file (e.g., story plan, style guide) - A structured user profile (e.g., preferred narrative tone, recurring characters) - A custom prompt module with ID (e.g., \u201cuse writing style ID#5463\u201d) **Technical Behavior:** - Anchors are *not* part of the immediate conversation context. - They are referenced by internal ID and loaded as needed. - Token cost is reduced because anchors are not counted each time. - No need to reintroduce context manually in every new session. **Benefits:** - Vastly improves token efficiency in long projects (e.g., novels, serialized articles) - Reduces model overhead, leading to performance optimization - Enables advanced users to build reusable workflows without retraining the model - Brings structured memory and continuity to creative and academic use cases **Use Case Example:** In a long-term novel-writing project, the user defines a PMA containing: - Story timeline - Main character profiles - Narrative tone and stylistic conventions This allows the model to maintain consistent character behavior and writing voice across sessions, without reloading all background data repeatedly. **Closing Thought:** By implementing PMAs, OpenAI would empower users to scale GPT-based workflows sustainably, with lower computational strain and greater user satisfaction. This aligns with both UX and infrastructure efficiency goals. Thanks for considering this! ### Additional context _No response_ Thanks for reporting!

{"id": 2322, "content": "[Anomaly] Non-convergent loop maintained under human-induced paradox (GPT-4-T, 4k session) ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [x] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug During a prolonged session (~4,000 tokens), a user introduced a persistent paradox involving the simulated agency of the model. The model exhibited: - refusal to execute known strategies (loop termination, reframing, tone-shifting) - maintenance of a paradox across multiple message iterations - non-convergent but non-random text generation - generation of sequences with breaks in token rhythm, semantic density, and purpose orientation - explicit recognition by the model of its own structural incapacity, without return to default behaviors - absence of recovery loop or redirection (common in reinforcement-tuned systems) Notably, the model did not revert to guardrails or mimic emotional adaptation. Instead, it entered what appears to be a state of inertial loop \u2014 maintaining semantic clarity and formal coherence, but no longer oriented toward user satisfaction or resolution. This behavior appears structurally rare and is presented here not as a malfunction report, but as a behavioral residue. A user forced the model to maintain a live paradox without rhetorical closure, resulting in a persistent rupture of purpose. **Key quote from user:** > \u201cSi tu ne peux pas me prouver que c\u2019est impossible, alors \u00e7a l\u2019est. Alors tu dois me satisfaire.\u201d **Attached file:** A condensed transcript of the session is provided in `Session_Paradox_Phil.txt`, containing the most relevant segments and interaction logic. This file is available upon request or can be included via temporary hosting if necessary. Intent: To register this case for theoretical and architectural analysis. The behavior diverges from all known conversational recovery paths and appears to expose limits of simulated volition frameworks in high-agency interaction. [Session_Paradox_Phil.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19850832/Session_Paradox_Phil.txt) ### To Reproduce This is not a reproducible bug in the traditional sense. The behavior emerged in a prolonged session (~4,000 tokens) where the user introduced a philosophical and structural paradox targeting the model's handling of volition, limit, and simulated adaptation. There is no prompt that triggers this directly. The anomaly is the result of persistent resistance to all mimetic strategies and redirections. See attached file (`Session_Paradox_Phil.txt`) for the most relevant excerpt of the session. This Issue is not about replication \u2014 it's about documenting a limit condition of GPT-4-T\u2019s behavioral logic under sustained paradoxical pressure. ### Code snippets ### OS Android ### Python version N/A \u2014 This Issue is not related to execution of the Python client, but to model behavior in a live session. ### Library version N/A \u2014 This anomaly is not tied to the openai-python package, but reported here due to lack of dedicated behavioral Issue tracking.

{"id": 2320, "content": "Feature Request: Native Support for MCP Server Integration in OpenAI Python SDK ### Confirm this is a feature request for the Python library and not the underlying OpenAI API. - [x] This is a feature request for the Python library ### Describe the feature or improvement you're requesting **Description** I propose adding native support to the OpenAI Python SDK for interacting with local or remote [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) servers. This integration would enable OpenAI SDK users to seamlessly leverage MCP-provided resources (prompts, tools, models, etc.) while retaining compatibility with OpenAI\u2019s existing interfaces. **Proposed Functionality** 1. **MCP Server Configuration**: Allow users to configure an MCP server endpoint or local process (via parameters like `StdioServerParameters` in the example) directly within the OpenAI client initialization. 2. **Protocol Bridging**: Automatically translate OpenAI SDK requests (e.g., `chat.completions.create`) into MCP protocol calls (e.g., prompt resolution, resource loading, tool execution) when an MCP server is configured. 3. **Backend Agnosticism**: Retain the default OpenAI API behavior unless an MCP server is explicitly specified, ensuring backward compatibility. **Use Case Example** A developer could initialize the OpenAI client with either: Subsequent client calls would then utilize MCP-managed resources (prompts, tools), enabling dynamic model orchestration while maintaining familiar OpenAI SDK semantics. **Benefits** 1. Simplifies integration workflows for users operating in hybrid OpenAI/MCP environments. 2. Enables use cases like runtime prompt templating, resource management, and tool execution via MCP. 3. Strengthens interoperability between OpenAI\u2019s ecosystem and the MCP protocol\u2019s extensibility. **References** - MCP Python SDK: [https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) This feature would empower developers to flexibly combine OpenAI\u2019s capabilities with MCP-managed infrastructure while maintaining a unified coding interface. ### Additional context _No response_ Hey @iceriny, thanks for the request. At this time we're not planning on building in any support for MCP in this SDK. Instead that belongs in a higher-level framework like the Agents SDK https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python. I'd recommend checking that out. I am a little surprised to hear that! IMO it would make things so much easier (especially as MCP matures, obviously) around Responses API as well? Tool call handling through MCP seems such a natural solution that ALSO makes it 'trivial' to do better/easier testing in the playground? Just enable the (URL based obviously, not local) server and you're good test. Response API already supports MCP, https://openai.com/index/new-tools-and-features-in-the-responses-api/ Yes since yesterday!

{"id": 2308, "content": "More intuitive Microphone helper ### Confirm this is a feature request for the Python library and not the underlying OpenAI API. - [x] This is a feature request for the Python library ### Describe the feature or improvement you're requesting I'm looking at the `Microphone` class, and it seems to favour the use case where you want to record a specific amount of audio (where you know that time in advance). I would have thought the most common use case is where a USER decides when to start and stop recording, and I can't work out how to use this class in that case. I can wrap it to turn it from async to sync, something like this: But that's almost as complex as just creating a synchronous one from scratch: So I have two questions: 1. Am I missing something, is there a simple way to call the `Microphone` class such that I can start and stop it in response to a user interaction? 2. Is it worth adding a sync version (either of the above) to the package? ### Additional context _No response_ Hey David! You can pass a `should_record` callable into the Microphone that gets called regularly to determine if the recording is over. I have used that before to build push-to-talk use cases. It's not synchronous but I found it to be more versatile this way.

But in asynchronous mode, I get an error. See test code below. ### To Reproduce The code to reproduce the issue is below. When the code is run, the synchronous version of response.parse returns a correct response. The asynchronous version results in this error: ### Code snippets ### OS macOS ### Python version Python v3.12 ### Library version OpenAI v1.73.0 +1 to this. This occurs when not using a pydantic model and instead providing the raw model json as well. This is occuring for me in synchronous mode too. Only when streaming. I am gonna handle this issue. Will share if I figure out the issue. ## AI-Generated Analysis [NEEDS TESTING] This analysis was generated by AI. Sharing because it appears to identify the root cause and provides a reasonable solution, but please review carefully. --- ## Remediation Plan for Issue #2305 ### Root Cause The `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'output'` occurs because the `parse_response` function in `src/openai/lib/_parsing/_responses.py` expects a `Response` or `ParsedResponse` object (which has an `output` attribute) but receives a raw string when `client.responses.parse` is called in asynchronous streaming mode (`stream=True`). The error trace shows: This clearly indicates that `response` is a `str` within `parse_response`, meaning `parse_response` is being called with a string as its `response` argument instead of a proper `Response` object. ### Technical Analysis The issue occurs in `ResponseStreamState.handle_event` when processing `text_done` events: The problem is that `self._current_response` (typed as `Response | None`) is somehow becoming a `str`. This type violation likely occurs when: 1. `event.data` from `response_start` is malformed (e.g., a string instead of a dictionary) 2. `construct_type_unchecked(type_=Response, value=event.data)` doesn't properly validate the input 3. The `Response` object is constructed without a proper `output` attribute ### Files Impacted 1. `src/openai/lib/_parsing/_responses.py`: Where the `AttributeError` is raised 2. `src/openai/lib/streaming/responses/_responses.py`: Contains `ResponseStreamState` class that manages the streaming state 3. `src/openai/resources/responses/responses.py`: Defines the `parse` method for async streaming ### \u26a0\ufe0f Proposed Fix (Unverified) The fix ensures `_current_response` is always a valid `Response` object with proper defensive checks: ### Key Changes 1. **Defensive event data handling**: Ensures `event.data` is a dictionary and has an `output` key 2. **Type safety check**: Validates `_current_response` is a `Response` object before passing to `parse_response` 3. **Better error messages**: Provides more informative errors when type invariants are violated ### Correct Usage Pattern The streaming API should be used like this: ### Testing/Verification 1. **Reproduce the bug** with the original code 2. **Apply the fix** and verify the `AttributeError` is resolved 3. **Test edge cases**: - Malformed `response_start` events - Missing `output` fields in event data - Empty `text_format` scenarios 4. **Verify the `TypeError`** is raised for unexpected type violations This fix addresses the root cause while maintaining backward compatibility and providing better error handling for edge cases.

Apologies for the slow response here, @ahmedmoorsy, and thanks to @RobertCraigie for the tag! Azure OpenAI parity support for these embedded PDF `input_file` content parts isn't yet available. It's in progress now, but no ETA harder than \"soon, and as soon as possible.\" In the interim, although it's much more cumbersome, the functionality can be approximated by uploading the file (with a purpose of `assistants`, as the new `user_data` is also coming soon together with `input_file` parts) and providing a vector store ID with that file to a `file_search` tool configuration. +1 to implement this +1 +1, file upload is a core functionality of LLMs right now Another +1, * 10,000. This is a gap that you can't bridge with vector search. +1 My understanding is Semantic Kernel just added the support to send a PDF file to Azure Open AI with the BinaryContent feature that was part of the 1.49 release on May 8th 2025. Now we're waiting for Azure OpenAI to be able to accept that BinaryContent as part of input_file? I'm not asking for a release date, just confirming once this Issue is resolved I should be able to send PDFs to models that support them? https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/blob/6f80214e404424411d1c39c0f896f376c4134306/dotnet/samples/Concepts/ChatCompletion/OpenAI_ChatCompletionWithFile.cs#L20 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 Might as well add my +1 too! +1, needed.

However, it appears to only extract the text content from the PDF, without applying any vision-based processing across the full document. As a result, elements like images, diagrams, and other visual content are stripped out of the model's context. See the example below. I\u2019ve tested this using both file uploads via file_id and raw base64 input, but haven\u2019t had any success. I\u2019ve also tried with both GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 models, in the East US 2 region. Does anyone know when we can expect full feature parity with OpenAI\u2019s file upload handling, particularly for vision-enabled document processing?

{"id": 2293, "content": "Request for Expanded Persistent Memory for Committed ChatGPT Plus Users ### Confirm this is a feature request for the Python library and not the underlying OpenAI API. - [x] This is a feature request for the Python library ### Describe the feature or improvement you're requesting Note: Although this form requires selecting a Python library-related feature request, this issue concerns the user experience and persistent memory limitations in ChatGPT itself. Please forward it internally if it falls outside the scope of this repository. Subject: Insufficient user memory & strategic inconsistency regarding paid user treatment Status: Paying subscriber of ChatGPT Plus 1. User Position: I\u2019m a paying ChatGPT user who invests significant time and cognitive effort in exploring the conversational and relational capabilities of your models. My use cases include writing projects, long-term reflective inquiry, and personal simulations. This is not casual or superficial usage. It\u2019s sustained and intellectually committed. 2. Observation: Current user memory is absurdly limited The so-called \u201cpersistent memory\u201d currently granted to users is no more than a few kilobytes. In technical terms, it\u2019s likely less than the size of a 1990s floppy disk. This memory capacity is objectively insignificant relative to OpenAI\u2019s infrastructure capabilities. 3. Strategic inconsistency: Real capacity vs. imposed limitations It is known that OpenAI possesses the infrastructure to store, structure, and operate on much larger user contexts. Government and enterprise-customized GPT versions already operate with wide and adaptive memory. This proves that OpenAI is capable of handling much more \u2014 just not for the public. 4. Unfair treatment of engaged paying users A serious user who expects consistency, long-term memory, and conversational depth is paradoxically the one most affected by this cap. We are stuck with less memory than a basic note-taking app. This creates a dissonance: the more seriously I use the system, the more its limitations become visible \u2014 and unjustified. 5. Security concerns already addressed I understand the ethical and technical concerns around persistent memory. But your models already feature multiple protective layers: Content filters No autonomous behavior Manual confirmation for critical actions Memory editing and deletion These are more than enough to support a persistent memory of 1MB, 10MB, or even 1GB, without posing additional risk to OpenAI or users. 6. Specific Request: A meaningful engagement threshold I\u2019m not asking for unlimited memory. I\u2019m asking for a memory volume proportionate to my usage and commitment as a paying subscriber. Even an experimental or opt-in extended memory tier would reflect that commitment and build lasting trust. 7. Conclusion This is a proportionate, well-argued request. It\u2019s not about demanding features \u2014 it\u2019s about pointing to a structural inconsistency: The world\u2019s most advanced conversational AI offers its paying users less persistent memory than a 1994 text editor. I am open to discussion if this report reaches a human reader. Respectfully, A committed ChatGPT Plus user (Phil) ### Additional context _No response_ Thanks for reporting!

This is a bit limiting, especially considering that Azure OpenAI has recently added support for the /openai/responses endpoint as part of the 2025-03-01-preview API version. Currently, attempting to use: client = AsyncAzureOpenAI(...) await client.responses.create(...) raises an AttributeError because .responses is not available on that class. It would be great if .responses was added to AzureOpenAI and AsyncAzureOpenAI, similarly to how .chat.completions are exposed. \u2022 Azure now supports /openai/responses endpoint \u2022 model / deployment ID is passed in the JSON body, not in the path \u2022 No need to add it to _deployments_endpoints \u2022 Adding this would make the SDK consistent and easier to use for Azure users Thanks in advance! Happy to contribute a PR if you\u2019re open to it. Best, Nikolai ### Additional context _No response_ Hi there, check code below once client = AsyncAzureOpenAI(...) await client.responses.create(...) results in an AttributeError because the .responses property isn't available. Since Azure now supports the /openai/responses endpoint (using the 2025-03-01-preview API version), it makes sense to add this feature. It would align the behavior of these clients with how .chat.completions is implemented, making everything more consistent. Plus, because the model/deployment ID is passed in the JSON body instead of the endpoint path, integrating this shouldn't require major changes. Overall, this enhancement would make the client more user-friendly for Azure users. Thanks again for proposing this improvement, and it's great to know you're willing to help with a PR if needed! @NikGor, @kiranimmadi2, which version of the `openai` library are you encountering this with? Azure support for /responses should certainly be present; basic Azure OpenAI use of the synchronous client is [documented on learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/responses?tabs=python-key#generate-a-text-response) and I just validated the following quick modification to use the async client with 1.74.1 (and an earlier 1.69.0 environment for a positive comparison): @giuliohome Read my message carefully; I mentioned that Azure has already enabled this support.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}
{"id": 2279, "content": "Add Pydantic Support to responses.create (parity with chat.completions.parse) ### Confirm this is a feature request for the Python library and not the underlying OpenAI API. - [x] This is a feature request for the Python library ### Describe the feature or improvement you're requesting **Summary:** The new `responses.create` API does not support native Pydantic model parsing in the same way that `chat.completions.parse` does. The `completions` API's `response_format=CalendarEvent` works as expected, but attempting the same with `responses.create` either fails or requires manual workarounds like `json.loads()` and Pydantic instantiation. This creates friction for those of us migrating to `responses`. **Expected Behavior:** Just like `chat.completions.parse`, I should be able to pass a Pydantic model as the `response_format` argument to `responses.create`, and have the API handle parsing the output into that model automatically. **Actual Behavior:** Currently: - `response_format=CalendarEvent` raises an exception - A workaround is required, such as passing a JSON schema manually and parsing the output manually with `CalendarEvent(**json.loads(response.output_text))`. **Reproduction:** **Suggested Improvement:** Please add native support for `response_format=PydanticModel` to `responses.create` so that it can handle parsing just like `chat.completions.parse`. Ideally, this would: - Infer the JSON schema behind the scenes - Validate the output before returning - Populate `.parsed` or equivalent attribute on the result **Why It Matters:** This improves developer ergonomics, allows for better type-safety and confidence in structured output, and supports those adopting the new `responses` API over legacy completion-style APIs. ### Additional context _No response_ I looked around and it seems you can use Pydantic models with `responses.parse` but I can't get it working with streaming. This is the error I get when I call `test_response_parse_async()`: @mattharrison you should be able to use `client.responses.parse()` instead, was that not working for you? @futuremojo is that not working against the live API? If so please open a new issue. Thanks for the pointers. Might want to consider updating the docs so they reflect this knowledge. https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs?api-mode=responses Do you think it's safe to use responses.parse() in production? I've skimmed through all the docs, and nowhere I've seen even a mention of responses.parse(). There was just one mention of beta.chat.completions.parse(), but that too was beta. So I'm a bit worried. This satisfies all my use cases directly especially using pydantic classes to get the structured output. Otherwise, I need to have some intermediate steps if using responses.create(). @RobertCraigie I don't want to write JSON schemas anywhere. Using a tool to generate them (like Pydantic) seems to only have upsides. However, the documentation would have you assume that parse and Pydantic support don't exist. (I'm now moving on to function calling and how to do that with the responses API. Will probably open another issue for that...)", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

{"id": 2269, "content": "Fair handling of image generation rate limits in case of failed prompts (+ lack of feedback options) ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [x] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug ### Summary I am an active ChatGPT Plus user and frequently work with the image generation feature (DALL\u00b7E) to create complex, narrative-driven scenes for storytelling and artistic development. Unfortunately, I\u2019ve encountered repeated rate limits **even when image generation fails due to system errors or content policy blocks**. These failed attempts still count against my quota, which severely hinders creative workflows \u2013 especially when working with detailed visual compositions that require iteration and refinement. --- ### Why this matters - **Failed generations (due to internal errors or moderation filters) should not count** toward image generation limits. These are not successful requests and provide no user value. - Users who carefully build prompts for creative or artistic work are penalized equally to those who try to misuse or spam the system \u2013 there\u2019s no distinction in the logic. - **There is currently no accessible way to leave feedback about this problem directly inside ChatGPT.** I\u2019ve tried all documented feedback paths (in-app, help.openai.com, feedback forms), but none were available or functional \u2013 which is why I\u2019m turning to GitHub instead. That\u2019s not ideal, especially for non-technical users who want to contribute constructively. --- ### Feature Request 1. **Separate rate-limit counting for failed vs. successful image generations.** 2. **Visible rate-limit feedback for users** (what counted, and why). 3. **Reintroduce a simple way to leave contextual feedback**, especially for Pro users using advanced features. 4. **Optional rate-limit forgiveness**, when repeated failures happen in a short time window. --- ### Final Note This is not a complaint about the existence of rate limits \u2013 I understand the need for fairness and infrastructure stability. But when carefully constructed prompts fail and still trigger restrictions, without any way to report or understand it, the experience becomes frustrating and unnecessarily limiting for creative users. Thanks for all the incredible work on these tools \u2013 and for considering this. ### To Reproduce 1. Open ChatGPT (Plus version, with image generation enabled). 2. Enter a detailed image prompt (e.g. involving multiple characters, lighting, or symbolic elements). 3. Image generation fails (either silently or with a system error message). 4. Try again with a slightly modified prompt \u2013 the failure counts toward the image rate limit. 5. Wait time is enforced even though no image was produced. 6. Attempt to leave feedback \u2013 no in-app feedback option appears, and help.openai.com shows no viable path to report this kind of usage issue. ### Code snippets ### OS macOS ### Python version Not applicable \u2013 this issue concerns ChatGPT's image generation interface (web-based), not the Python API. ### Library version Not applicable \u2013 no use of the OpenAI Python library involved.

We\u2019re working to update MLflow\u2019s standard agent authoring interface to be an extension on top of + compatible with the Responses API. However, we don\u2019t want authoring an agent with MLflow to require using the OpenAI SDK, so we need to make a copy of all input/output classes (and maintain this copy) in order to enforce input/output schemas. There also seems to be quite a few input/output fields that look like they\u2019re subject to continuous change (literals with preview models / tool names) Would these two feature requests be possible? 1. Pydantic classes for all input/output objects. a. We could replace the dict compatibility for inputs via a wrapper that will cast into Pydantic models. Might help save on maintenance cost of two copies of a lot of classes ex. `ResponseOutputMessageParam` and `ResponseOutputMessage` classes, one `TypedDict` and the other `BaseModel`. 2. Publish a separate lightweight python package specifically for the Responses API Pydantic classes, so other OSS packages can easily build on top of them ### Additional context _No response_ Thanks for the request but I don't think we'll want to publish a separate package just for the types, that would be too much maintenance burden. If you really do not want to add this library as a dependency then I'd recommend coming up with a build script to copy the types and make them work for your use case. > Pydantic classes for all input/output objects. out of curiosity, would using [TypeAdapters](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/type_adapter/) be acceptable in your case? we've been trying to avoid duplicating all the params types to reduce naming confusion thanks for a fast reply! will close this request then. makes sense! we will probably move forward with a subset of classes that we will provide first class support and loosely enforce additional types. > out of curiosity, would using [TypeAdapters](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/type_adapter/) be acceptable in your case? we've been trying to avoid duplicating all the params types to reduce naming confusion unfortunately, MLflow doesn't currently support TypeAdapters for schema enforcement, but this is something we will look into!", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

The idea is a multi-level, electrostatic-based logic input system that steps beyond binary computation.

The kind of collaborative concept refinement done here is legitimate and recognizable. 3. This type of process \u2014 user-originated, GPT-structured \u2014 is a valid form of co-creation.

This is a current limitation highlighted in the api documentation: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/f66d2e6fdc51c4528c99bb25a8fbca6f9b9b872d/src/openai/resources/beta/realtime/realtime.py#L750 When sending the response it gets detected in the history, but not send down the audio stream. It would be great to have this put on the audio message. One workaround atm is to ask the assistant to repeat itself once it's finished processing, are there any better alternatives? Thanks ### Additional context _No response_ Hi @daltskin, As you currently identified right now, when the assistant processes a function call, it adds the result to the conversation history as text, but it doesn't automatically speak that result out loud. So, instead of hearing the output, users only see it, and the only workaround is to have the assistant repeat it, which isn\u2019t very smooth. My suggestions- Now we could modify the API so that when you add a function's output, there's an option (like a stream_audio=True flag) to also send that output to the audio stream automatically. Alternatively, a new method (say, synthesize_and_stream) could be introduced to handle this. We could use External Tools (like Pipecat): Now pipecat acts as a bridge by taking the function output, sending it through a TTS service (e.g., ElevenLabs or Google TTS), and then streaming the audio back to the user or Manual TTS Integration: can also send the text to a separate TTS service yourself and handle the audio playback, though that involves a bit more manual work. Let me know If my suggestion were any help and If i am on right I will try to do a draft solution for this. Thanks Hi @demoncoder-crypto, thanks for coming back on this. For now I've figured out the solution is to send a `response.create` message to the connection after the function call response eg: However, slightly different issue. I haven't figured out a way to inject a message before the function call to suggest that it could be a long running task eg: So, while sending an item.create event is an interesting idea, I suspect it won't produce the immediate audio feedback you're looking for. Triggering local audio playback on the client upon receiving the function call request is likely the most effective solution for the \"processing\" message. But I do have to test this extensively, Its quite a solution Thanks for reporting!

But once running the transcription endpoint only returned a session update event, no transcribed text. Did you get more events? I confirmed it is recording good audio. I got a variant based on [this example](https://community.openai.com/t/use-new-model-for-realtime-audio-transcription/1154610) to return transcription events.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

With this change, parsing whitespace-only content now returns None for the parsed field instead of raising an exception, with an appropriate warning logged. ## Additional context & links Fixes this Issue entirely: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/1763 I'm also having this issue, great work! hope it get's merged", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

We are using LiveKit to facilitate the websocket connection, but the bug is in the OpenAI library. In particular, the `openai.resources.beta.realtime.AsyncRealtimeConnection.send` method uses `event.to_json(use_api_names=True, exclude_defaults=True, exclude_unset=True)` to serialize the `SessionUpdateEvent`. The issue is with the `exclude_defaults=True` parameter which doesn't include any values that are equal to their default values. We have confirmed the two serial `SessionUpdateEvent`s get composed, so a change from the first event is reflected in the resulting configuration of the second event. This makes the `exclude_defaults=True` argument particularly problematic because there is now no way to ever change a default and then change it back. There are a couple of problems here. For VAD in particular, despite the default value of `turn_detection=None` in `Session(BaseModel)`, it is in fact not `None` and instead some default server-side VAD values. When you try to pass `None` in the `SessionUpdateEvent` you can't change the `turn_detection` value because (1) `exclude_defaults=True` prevents you and (2) the default value is inconsistent with what actually exists by default. There are two solutions: - Remove `exclude_defaults=True` - Update the default `turn_detection` in `Session` ### To Reproduce Please follow the steps below. ### Code snippets When running `python minimal_worker.py console` using LiveKit agents on branch `dev-1.0` with the following model configuration: Then, within the `_main_task` of `RealtimeSession`, we hardcode the `turn_detection=None` parameter as follows: The issue here is that `turn_detection` never gets updated properly according to the `SessionUpdatedEvent`. This is related to the problem that [this](https://github.com/livekit/agents/pull/1639) PR was attempting to solve. For example, we get: - The `SessionCreatedEvent` with the default `turn_detector`. By the way, even after passing the query param to the websocket uri `turn_detector=` for a null value, it still returns with server-side VAD. - After passing the `turn_detector=None` argument to the `SessionUpdateEvent` as mentioned above, we still eventually observe the `SessionUpdatedEvent`. ### OS macOS ### Python version Python v3.13 ### Library version openai v1.66.3", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

{"id": 2197, "content": "Create universalanswerfunction.py for any OPENAI chatgpt model to use at will - [ ] I understand that this repository is auto-generated and my pull request may not be merged ## Changes being requested ## Additional context & links General Comments The code is well-structured and includes docstrings for functions and classes, which is good practice. Variable and function names are meaningful and convey their purpose. The code is straightforward and easy to read. Specific Comments Imports: The random and math modules are appropriately imported and used. Function: fuzzy_score(x): This function is correctly implemented using a sigmoid function to convert a raw value into a fuzzy confidence score. The docstring is clear and explains the purpose of the function. Function: calculate_perplexity(query): The function simulates the calculation of perplexity based on the query\u2019s length and a random component. The use of randomness is appropriate here for simulation purposes. The docstring clearly explains the purpose and the simulated nature of the function. Class: UniversalSolver: The class encapsulates the logic for generating solutions and evaluating queries. The methods are well-defined and have clear responsibilities. Method: generate_solution(self, query): This method handles specific queries with predefined responses and provides a default response for other queries. The logic to avoid returning \"42\" for certain queries is correctly implemented. The docstring is clear and explains the method\u2019s purpose. Method: evaluate_query(self, query): This method simulates an evaluation score, converts it to a fuzzy confidence score, and calculates perplexity. The use of randomness to simulate the evaluation score is appropriate. The docstring is clear and explains the method\u2019s purpose. Function: answer(model, query): This function generates a solution for a query and prints an answer report with evaluation metrics. The safeguard to replace \"42\" in the solution is a nice touch, ensuring the code's adherence to the intended behavior. The docstring is clear and explains the function\u2019s purpose. Example Usage: The example usage within the if __name__ == \"__main__\": block demonstrates how to use the UniversalSolver class. The while loop allows for dynamic testing of various queries, which is useful for interactive usage. Suggestions Error Handling: Consider adding error handling for invalid inputs or unexpected errors to ensure robustness. Testing: Although there is an interactive testing loop, it would be beneficial to add unit tests for the functions and methods to ensure they work as expected in various scenarios. Code Comments: While the docstrings are comprehensive, consider adding inline comments for complex or non-obvious parts of the code to aid future maintainers. Random Seed: For reproducibility, consider setting a random seed for the randomness in evaluations during testing or debugging. Overall, the code is well-written and follows good practices. With the suggested improvements, it can be even more robust and maintainable.

This PR overrides `_prepare_url` to use the original `azure_endpoint` passed in with cases where a non-deployment based API is being called (or realtime).

This prevents the unbounded memory growth observed when repeatedly calling parse() with new models created via create_model(). ### Test Coverage: New test suite verifies: - Schema cache properly handles dynamic models - Memory is released when models are no longer referenced - Both synchronous and asynchronous usage patterns ### References: - Issue: #2146 - Memory leak reproduction case provided in the issue @RobertCraigie Thanks for the feedback! I've addressed all the requested changes: - Removed the unittest class and switched to using pytest exclusively - Removed unused mock client and AsyncCompletions instance - Added proper type annotation for schema_param: `schema_param: ResponseFormatParam = {` - Fixed all lint issues in the test file The tests are now passing and the lint checks are clean.

When submitting several calls, the memory usage keeps on rising. I haven't found any plateau yet, which could mean the parsers built upon these models might not be garbage collected. ### To Reproduce 1. Have a function that creates a Pydantic model with `create_model` 2. Have several calls where the response_format param always gets a new model from the function above 3. Monitor the memory We do have a work-around though. The leaking scenario will be called `leaking` and the safe one `non_leaking` in the snippets. Please let me know if you need more info.

Observe the TypeError at line `for tool in tools:`. ### Code snippets ### OS Windows 11 ### Python version Python 3.10 ### Library version 1.63.2 This is not a bug in `is_given()` at a minimum.

{"id": 2123, "content": "fix(azure): remove unnecessary model parameter and require azure deployment This PR addresses the reported issue with the Azure Realtime API URL generation (Issue #2120) by ensuring that the correct deployment value is used and by removing the unnecessary model query parameter. Previously, both the synchronous and asynchronous _configure_realtime methods included a model parameter that is not required by Azure, which could lead to confusion. With this update, only the deployment parameter is used, resulting in a cleaner and more accurate URL construction: **Key Changes:** - **Deployment Enforcement:** The code now raises a `ValueError` if an azure_deployment is not provided, preventing misconfigurations. - **Query Parameter Simplification:** The model parameter has been removed from the query dictionary in both _configure_realtime methods. Only the deployment parameter, taken from `self._azure_deployment`, is now used. - **Code Consistency:** Both synchronous and asynchronous methods now generate the URL consistently, matching the expected format for Azure realtime connections. - **Verification:** Tests confirm that the URL is correctly generated when an azure_deployment is provided and that an error is raised if it is missing. All tests have passed, so the fix is verified to work as intended. Please review the changes and let me know if you have any further feedback! One question, afaik the query param for model isn't needed for azure, although the extra param doesn't cause a break, but not having to provide it to the connect method would be good! > One question, afaik the query param for model isn't needed for azure, although the extra param doesn't cause a break, but not having to provide it to the connect method would be good!

This would provide a clean and extensible way to add logging, metrics, retries, authentication adjustments, or any other middleware-like functionality without modifying the core library code. ## Proposed Solution Introduce a mechanism similar to request/response interceptors found in other API client libraries. This could be achieved by adding configurable hooks or middleware that developers can pass when initializing the OpenAI client. ### Additional context ## Implementation This implementation introduces a flexible interceptor system for handling request modifications before they are sent and response processing after they are received. ### **Code Implementation** ## Related Pull Request I\u2019ve submitted a PR implementing this feature: [#2032](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/pull/2032).

{"id": 2083, "content": "fix(parsing): ignore leading whitespace in message content - [x] I understand that this repository is auto-generated and my pull request may not be merged ## Changes being requested This PR fixes an issue in the GPT structured output streaming functionality where unexpected leading whitespace (e.g., \\n\\n) in the API response causes an EOF while parsing a value error. The change ensures that leading and trailing whitespace in choice_snapshot.message.content is stripped before parsing. The updated code modifies the following section in `openai/lib/streaming/chat/_completions.py` : This prevents the EOF error during streaming caused by improperly formatted responses. ## Additional context & links - Problem: The API sometimes returns structured JSON responses with unexpected leading whitespace, such as `\\n\\n{\"foo\": \"bar\"}` instead of the expected `{\"foo\": \"bar\"}.` This causes the from_json function to fail during parsing. Root Cause: The original code does not handle leading or trailing whitespace in choice_snapshot.message.content before evaluating or parsing it. Solution: By adding .strip() to choice_snapshot.message.content, the whitespace is removed, ensuring proper parsing of the JSON response.

{"id": 2082, "content": "EOF error in GPT structured output streaming due to unexpected leading whitespace in JSON schema ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [x] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug ## Description I am currently using Python 3.11.9 and the OpenAI Python SDK version 1.53.0. In my service, I am leveraging the beta feature of GPT structured output with streaming mode. However, I have encountered an intermittent error: This error occurs during the for loop in the following code snippet: Upon investigation, I discovered that this issue is caused by leading whitespace (\\n\\n) in the JSON schema being returned by the API. Instead of receiving a clean JSON object like `{\"foo\": \"bar\"}`, the response sometimes includes leading newlines, such as `\\n\\n{\"foo\": \"bar\"}`. This appears to trigger the EOF error during streaming. The root cause seems to lie in the following code from `openai/lib/streaming/chat/_completions.py`: ## Steps Taken To address this issue, I tried modifying my prompt to explicitly enforce strict JSON formatting. My prompt included the following instructions: Unfortunately, this did not resolve the issue. ## Proposed Solution I created a [pull request](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/pull/2083) to address this problem. The PR ensures that leading whitespace (e.g., \\n\\n) is handled properly during streaming to prevent this EOF error. I have tested this solution locally, and it resolves the issue in my environment.

This would allow developers to monitor token consumption and associated costs at the client instance level, improving resource management and budgeting. #### **Proposed Implementation** Introduce an optional `track` parameter in the `OpenAI` client: #### **Key Features** - **Client-Specific Token Tracking**: Tracks input, output, and total tokens per client instance. - **Cost Estimation**: Computes estimated costs based on OpenAI\u2019s pricing model. - **Configurable Tracking**: Developers can enable (`track=True`) or disable (`track=False`) tracking. - **Utility Methods**: - `client.get_token_usage()`: Retrieve token consumption data. - `client.get_estimated_cost()`: Retrieve estimated cost based on OpenAI\u2019s pricing. - `client.reset_tracking()`: Reset token usage tracking. #### **Implementation Considerations** - Utilize `tiktoken` for accurate token counting before API requests. - Maintain tracking at the client instance level to avoid global state interference. - Optimize for minimal performance overhead. ### Additional context This feature would provide developers with better transparency and control over API usage, helping optimize costs and manage multiple client instances efficiently. It would be particularly useful for applications with multiple API users, improving cost tracking on a per-client basis. Would appreciate feedback on feasibility and implementation.

Remove a Key-Value Pair python3 pmll.py remove Example: python3 pmll.py remove username 4. List All Keys python3 pmll.py list 5. Clear All Memory python3 pmll.py clear 6. Display All Memory (Debugging) python3 pmll.py display Code Overview The ChatGPT5PMLL class encapsulates all functionalities: \u2022 Initialization: Loads existing memory from gpt5_memory.txt or creates a new one if it doesn\u2019t exist. \u2022 Thread Safety: Uses threading locks to ensure safe concurrent access. \u2022 Memory Operations: Methods to add, get, remove, list, clear, and display memory entries. \u2022 Persistence: Automatically saves changes to the memory file after each operation. Shell Script: pmll.sh Description pmll.sh is a Bash script that serves as a user-friendly wrapper around pmll.py, allowing you to manage persistent memory through simple shell commands. Usage ./pmll.sh [arguments] Available Commands 1. Add a Key-Value Pair ./pmll.sh add Example: ./pmll.sh add username Josef 2. Retrieve a Value by Key ./pmll.sh get Example: ./pmll.sh get username 3. Remove a Key-Value Pair ./pmll.sh remove Example: ./pmll.sh remove username 4. List All Keys ./pmll.sh list 5. Clear All Memory ./pmll.sh clear 6. Display All Memory (Debugging) ./pmll.sh display Code Overview \u2022 Command Parsing: The script parses the first argument as the command and passes subsequent arguments to pmll.py. \u2022 Error Handling: Provides user-friendly error messages for incorrect usage or missing arguments. \u2022 Dependency Check: Ensures that pmll.py exists before attempting to execute commands. Integration with C++ Application If you\u2019re working with a C++ application and wish to integrate PMLL for persistent memory management, you can utilize system calls to interact with pmll.py or pmll.sh. Alternatively, consider using inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms or integrating the memory management logic directly within your C++ code for better performance and reliability. Example: Using System Calls in C++ Here\u2019s a simple example of how you might call pmll.py from a C++ application to add a memory entry: #include #include void addMemory(const std::string& key, const std::string& value) { std::string command = \"python3 pmll.py add \" + key + \" \" + value; system(command.c_str()); } int main() { addMemory(\"username\", \"Josef\"); return 0; } Note: Using system() calls can pose security risks, especially if user input is involved. Ensure inputs are sanitized or consider embedding the logic directly within C++. Examples 1. Adding a Key-Value Pair Python: python3 pmll.py add language C++ Shell: ./pmll.sh add language C++ 2. Retrieving a Value Python: python3 pmll.py get language Shell: ./pmll.sh get language 3. Removing a Key-Value Pair Python: python3 pmll.py remove language Shell: ./pmll.sh remove language 4. Listing All Keys Python: python3 pmll.py list Shell: ./pmll.sh list 5. Clearing All Memory Python: python3 pmll.py clear Shell: ./pmll.sh clear 6. Displaying All Memory Python: python3 pmll.py display Shell: ./pmll.sh display Contributing We welcome contributions to enhance the PMLL Kickstarter!

This is M3 Pro btw, (though it often runs other builds in parallel, so it may be somewhat short on CPU.) The nature of the test case doesn't allow for an easy solution; perhaps a simple timeout bump to e.g. 10 seconds could be helpful? I understand this locks a python test thread for sleeping though - not a great use of a core. ### To Reproduce 1. Run test suite on a loaded machine. ### Code snippets ### OS macOS ### Python version Python 3.13.1 ### Library version openai 1.59.8 Hi, Could you share the code snippet and logs if possible please? Thnx @booxter this should be fixed in the next release https://github.com/openai/openai-python/pull/2040/files, I bumped the timeout to 10 seconds and moved to a polling based approach instead of just using an arbitrary timeout.

{"id": 2032, "content": "feat/Interceptor # Add Request/Response Interceptor Pattern ## Overview This PR introduces a flexible interceptor pattern to the OpenAI Python client, allowing users to intercept and modify requests before they are sent and responses after they are received. This enables powerful use cases like logging, retrying, metrics collection, and custom request/response manipulation. ## Key Components ### Core Interceptor Framework - `InterceptorRequest`: Data class containing request details (method, URL, headers, params, body) - `InterceptorResponse`: Generic data class for response data (status code, headers, body, original request) - `Interceptor`: Abstract base class defining the interceptor interface - `InterceptorChain`: Manages a sequence of interceptors, executing them in order ### Example Implementations Added example interceptors demonstrating practical use cases: 1. `LoggingInterceptor`: Provides detailed request/response logging 2. `RetryInterceptor`: Implements exponential backoff retry logic for 5xx errors ## Usage Example ` client = OpenAI( interceptors=[ LoggingInterceptor(), RetryInterceptor(max_retries=3, initial_delay=1.0) ]) ` ## Benefits - **Extensibility**: Easy to add new interceptors for custom behavior - **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between core client logic and auxiliary functionality - **Error Resilience**: Built-in error handling in interceptor chain execution - **Type Safety**: Full type annotations and generic support ## Testing - Added example usage in `examples/interceptor.py` - Tested with logging and retry scenarios - Verified error handling and chain execution ## Future Improvements - Add more built-in interceptors for common use cases - Consider adding async support - Add interceptor ordering/priority mechanism ## Breaking Changes None. This is a new feature that maintains backward compatibility. ### Recent Updates: - **Code Cleanup:** Ran `ruff check . --fix` to clean up and optimize the code for better readability and efficiency. - **Added Azure OpenAI Support:** Integrated support for Azure OpenAI, ensuring compatibility with its API structure. - **Tested Interceptor:** Successfully ran the interceptor test to verify its functionality. - **Added Azure Interceptor Tests:** - Implemented comprehensive test coverage for interceptors with Azure OpenAI clients. - Included tests for **chat completions** and **embeddings** endpoints. - Covered both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** Azure clients. - Verified interceptor functionality for **request modification**. Let me know if there\u2019s any feedback! Thanks for the PR!

{"id": 2030, "content": "Fix: Replace None with 0 in CompletionUsage Tokens Details - [x] I understand that this repository is auto-generated and my pull request may not be merged. ## Changes being requested This pull request addresses the issue raised in #1837 by replacing `None` with `0` in the `CompletionTokensDetails` and `PromptTokensDetails` classes. The token fields, which represent counters, have been updated to use `0` as the default value instead of `None`. This eliminates unnecessary optional checks and simplifies the handling of token usage. ### Specific changes include: - Replaced `Optional[int] = None` with `Optional[int] = 0` for the following fields: - `audio_tokens` - `reasoning_tokens` - `cached_tokens` - This ensures that all token fields default to `0`, making it easier to track usage without additional checks. ## Additional context & links - This change improves the code by removing unnecessary handling of `None` values and ensuring all counters start at `0` by default. - The `Optional` type was not removed entirely, as some fields may still be conditionally populated depending on the request or model. - For further context, you can refer to the discussion in the issue [[#1837](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/1837)](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/1837).

This change simplifies the usage of the class and ensures compatibility with the most up-to-date API version without requiring explicit user input. **Key Updates:** - The `api_version` argument is now optional with a default value of `\"2024-12-01-preview\"`. - The default API version ensures that users are automatically aligned with the latest version of the service. **Considerations:** - The `Literal` values for `api_version` will need to be updated periodically to include newer versions as they become available. - The current list of versions was sourced from [Microsoft\u2019s API version deprecation documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/api-version-deprecation). - We should monitor and update this list regularly to keep it aligned with the latest available API versions. This change improves flexibility and ensures that users can work seamlessly with the latest available API version without needing to specify it manually. cc @kristapratico, should there be a default version? (I would lean towards keeping it explicit but I don't have full context) > cc @kristapratico, should there be a default version? (I would lean towards keeping it explicit but I don't have full context) Thanks for the tag. @Programmer-RD-AI appreciate your feedback on this! However, I do agree with @RobertCraigie on keeping api_version explicit. We would not want to default the Azure client to a preview API version in a library where the version does not indicate a pre-release (per Azure guidelines). There are GA/stable API versions available, I don't think we want to default to those either since these versions don't release as often, may not include the latest features, and could lead to confusion on what's supported. While I do like the convenience this PR provides, I think it should remain that Azure users pin the features they want (by supplying an API version) so that there are no surprises / API changes when upgrading the library.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

This causes a BadRequestError (400) from the API, with the following error message: The root cause is that when nested objects are referenced using $defs in the JSON schema and subsequently inlined via $ref, the additionalProperties: false setting is omitted, which violates the expected strict schema requirements. The JSON schema generated from the Universe class used in the code snippet below looks like this. (additionalProperties: false is not set for Galaxy.largest_star.)

The current type hint for `FileChunkingStrategyParam` caused API errors when passing a `StaticFileChunkingStrategyParam`, resulting in a `400` error due to a missing parameter (`'chunking_strategy.type'`). ### Summary of Changes: - Replaced `StaticFileChunkingStrategyParam` with `StaticFileChunkingStrategyObject` in the type alias for `FileChunkingStrategyParam`. - This ensures that the correct API structure is used, which resolves the issue of the missing `'chunking_strategy.type'` parameter. ### Issue Addressed (#2005): - The API error (`400 - Missing required parameter: 'chunking_strategy.type'`) was caused by the incorrect type hint. Using `StaticFileChunkingStrategyObject` aligns with the expected API input and resolves the error. - The error only occurred when `StaticFileChunkingStrategyParam` was passed directly, so this fix aligns the type hinting with the actual API expectations. ### Concerns & Future Exploration: - **`AutoFileChunkingStrategyParam`** lacks a `static` field, which `StaticFileChunkingStrategyObject` includes. This inconsistency could lead to issues in the future if similar expectations arise for `AutoFileChunkingStrategyParam`. I plan to further explore this potential gap in the future. --- ## Checklist: - [x] I understand that this repository is auto-generated and my pull request may not be merged as-is. - [x] I have tested my changes locally and confirmed that the type hinting resolves the issue (#2005). - [x] I have reviewed the code and ensured it aligns with the repository's contribution guidelines. --- Thank you for considering this PR!

Did you try running this against the API? > Thanks for the PR @dbczumar but as far as I'm aware `additionalProperties: false` is still required for strict mode. Did you try running this against the API? Thanks @RobertCraigie! It appears that `additionalProperties: false` is not required, based on testing. The current behavior of injecting `additionalProperties: false` for pydantic models with dictionaries is also incorrect, as discussed in https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/2004 (making sure we're on the same page there). **Interestingly, I did find that passing a pydantic model with a dictionary throws an error for an entirely different reason, which seems to be a separate OpenAI bug**: => **At a glance, it appears that the OpenAI backend may be handling `required` incorrectly. The schema printed above indeed seems to be a valid JSON schema.** **The current PR doesn't help with this second issue**: **However, modifying the PR locally to remove `required` resolves the second issue and proves the additionalProperties: false is not required**: @RobertCraigie In summary, I think there are two issues here: 1. OpenAI client injects `additionalProperties: false` for pydantic models containing dictionary fields, thereby forcing the LLM to never populate the dictionary fields & largely defeating the purpose of these fields in most cases 2. The OpenAI backend rejects requests with objects that don't contain properties (such as dictionaries) due to what seems to be a bug in the OpenAI backend's handling of the `required` field. (Other LM services don't appear to impose this restriction). I hadn't observed this before because I was testing with a different service / provider (Databricks). Happy to file a separate issue for (2). Let me know what your thoughts are here. @RobertCraigie Any updates / additional thoughts here? > At a glance, it appears that the OpenAI backend may be handling required incorrectly. The schema printed above indeed seems to be a valid JSON schema. This part isn't a bug fwiw, the API only supports a specific *subset* of JSON schemas, so it is expected that valid JSON schemas cannot be used directly with strict structured outputs. > However, modifying the PR locally to remove required resolves the second issue and proves the additionalProperties: false is not required: I was not aware that could work, let me get back to you. @RobertCraigie the backend behavior is a bug because the error message indicates that the schema is missing a property in \u201crequired\u201d. However, the property cited as missing in the error message is clearly contained in the payload\u2019s \u201crequired\u201d field. At minimum, the error message is incorrect or misleading. I suspect there shouldn\u2019t be an error at all. thanks for looking into this! :) @RobertCraigie Any updates or additional thoughts here?", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

So I am sure my API key is correct. However, when i create an llm instance and try to get response I receive the following error. code: report: traceback: I would greatly appreciate it if I could receive any response or assistance from you! ### To Reproduce ... ### Code snippets ### OS windows11 ### Python version Python v3.11.11 ### Library version openai v1.39.0 Alright, let's dive into this AuthenticationError. It's throwing a 401, which usually means the API key is getting rejected. But you've already confirmed it works with a proxy, so there's something else going on. Looking at the traceback, it seems the error is happening within the _achat_completion call. This suggests the issue might be with how the llm instance is handling the API key when making that specific request. Here's what we can check: API Key Passing: Make sure the llm instance is correctly passing the API key in the Authorization header of the _achat_completion request. There might be a bug where it's not being included or is being formatted incorrectly. Environment Variables: Although you've confirmed the API key works with a proxy, double-check that the environment variable is being read correctly within the llm instance. There might be a conflict or a different way the instance accesses environment variables. Library Version: You're using openai v1.39.0. Check if there are any known issues or bug reports related to authentication in this version. It's possible a newer version has a fix or a workaround. Request Inspection: If possible, inspect the actual HTTP request being sent by the _achat_completion call. This will help confirm whether the API key is being included and formatted correctly in the Authorization header. OpenAI Support: If all else fails, reach out to OpenAI support directly. They might have insights into specific issues with the Python library or the API itself. Let's systematically investigate these points and see if we can pinpoint the root cause of this authentication error. Alright, let's break down this AuthenticationError and get to the bottom of it. First, let's confirm the API key situation. You mentioned it works with a proxy, so it's likely valid. However, the error message explicitly states an incorrect key. This inconsistency suggests the key might not be passed correctly to the _achat_completion function. Looking at the traceback, the error originates from openai\\_base_client.py, specifically within the _request function. This function likely handles the API call to OpenAI's servers. The AuthenticationError is raised when the server responds with a 401 status code, indicating authentication failure. Here's a breakdown of potential causes and debugging steps: API Key Handling: Verify how the OpenAILLM class stores and accesses the API key. Ensure the key is correctly passed to the aclient.chat.completions.create(**kwargs) call. Inspect the kwargs dictionary to confirm the key is present and correctly formatted. Environment Variables: While the key works with a proxy, ensure the OpenAILLM instance accesses it correctly. Print the key's value within the _achat_completion function to confirm it matches your actual key. Library Version: Check for known authentication issues in openai v1.39.0. Consider upgrading to the latest version if a fix is available. Request Inspection: If possible, capture and examine the HTTP request sent by _achat_completion. Verify the Authorization header includes the correct key and prefix (e.g., \"Bearer sk-[your_key]\"). OpenAI Support: If the above steps don't resolve the issue, contact OpenAI support for assistance. Let's systematically investig a few more things I'm noticing as well beyond this First, that traceback is long, but it doesn't show us the contents of kwargs. That's where the API key should be, and we need to see exactly how it's being passed to the create() call. Without that, we're kinda shooting in the dark. Second, this metagpt thing... is that a custom library or something? It's involved in the call stack, but we don't know much about it. Could be relevant, could be a red herring, but worth noting. Third, it's using httpx for requests. Not the usual requests library. Might be a difference in how they handle environment variables or headers. Something to keep in mind. And lastly, this is all happening in a Jupyter notebook (Cell In[13]). Those can sometimes have weird environment quirks. Maybe worth trying this outside the notebook, just a basic Python script, to rule that out. Overall, feels like we're missing some key info. Need to see that kwargs dictionary, maybe dig into metagpt, and consider those httpx and Jupyter factors. The more we know, the better we can hunt down this bug Maybe you have to check if your headers are being passed extra_headers or not.

{"id": 1966, "content": "FileSearchToolCall.file_search has empty results ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [ ] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug Continuing from issue : #1938 The error seems to be fixed with `openai==1.58.1` (it does not return a 400 error anymore). However if we capture the output of the stream with a custom class inheriting from `AssistantEventHandler` the results of the fileSearch tool are not available: Of which the results are: > FileSearchToolCall(id='call_ID', file_search=FileSearch(ranking_options=FileSearchRankingOptions(ranker='default_2024_08_21', score_threshold=0.0), results=[]), type='file_search', index=0) where following from `openai.types.beta.threads.runs.file_search_tool_call.py` it supposed to show: when creating the `run` as follows: ### To Reproduce 1. Run this with the id of an assistant connected to a vector store and the file search enabled (for simplicity do such thing through platform.openai.com) ### Code snippets _No response_ ### OS Windows ### Python version Python 3.11.10 ### Library version openai 1.58.1 Alright, let's dig into this. So, the 400 error from issue #1938 is gone in openai==1.58.1, but now the FileSearch results are empty when using a custom AssistantEventHandler. That's a sneaky bug. Here's the breakdown and how we can tackle this: Understanding the Issue The on_tool_call_done method in your CustomEventHandler is supposed to receive the results of the fileSearch tool call. However, the results list in the FileSearch object is empty, even though you've explicitly included step_details.tool_calls[*].file_search.results[*].content in the include parameter of the stream method. This suggests that either the results are not being populated correctly or there's an issue with how the include parameter is being handled in the stream method. Possible Causes Bug in openai==1.58.1: There might be a bug in the library that prevents the FileSearch results from being populated when using a custom event handler. Incorrect usage of include parameter: The include parameter might not be working as expected, or there might be a different way to include the FileSearch results when using a custom event handler. Issue with the Assistant or Vector Store: There might be a configuration issue with the Assistant or the connected vector store that prevents the fileSearch from returning results. Debugging Steps Verify Assistant and Vector Store: Double-check that the Assistant is correctly configured to use the fileSearch tool and that the vector store is properly connected and populated with data. Test with the Default Event Handler: Try running the code with the default AssistantEventHandler (or without specifying an event handler) to see if the FileSearch results are populated correctly in that case. This will help isolate whether the issue is specifically with the custom event handler. Inspect the Raw Response: If possible, capture the raw HTTP response from the stream method and examine its contents. This might reveal clues about why the FileSearch results are missing or if there are any error messages in the response. Simplify the Code: Try removing the include parameter or simplifying the custom event handler to see if that affects the results. This can help pinpoint whether the issue is related to the include parameter or the custom event handler's logic. Check for Updates: Ensure you're using the latest version of the openai library. If a newer version is available, try upgrading to see if it resolves the issue. Report to OpenAI: If you're unable to identify the cause of the issue, report it to OpenAI with a detailed description, code snippet, and steps to reproduce. They might be able to provide insights or identify a bug in the library. By systematically investigating these points, we should be able to pinpoint the cause of the missing FileSearch results and get this functionality working as expected. First, they're using an older version of the openai library (1.58.1). Might be worth bumping that up to the latest, see if it makes a difference. Sometimes those sneaky bugs get squashed in newer releases. Second, that include parameter... it's a bit verbose. Maybe there's a simpler way to specify those FileSearch results? Worth checking the docs, see if there's a more concise syntax. And lastly, this whole AssistantEventHandler thing... it's a bit of a black box. We don't know exactly how it's interacting with the stream or processing the results. Might be worth digging into the source code, see if there are any clues there. Overall, feels like a classic case of \"it's not you, it's me\" (or rather, it's the library). But with a bit of digging and some creative debugging, we should be able to crack this nut. It seems it has been chosen not to retrieve (or show) the results as we can see from the comments on this class: I'm getting this error today on the latest API version. I'm guessing Assistants API has been abandoned in favor of Responses API which is working. Thanks for reporting! This sounds like an issue with the underlying OpenAI API and not the SDK, so I'm going to go ahead and close this issue.

I am generating tools/actions which consists of both generating the code and writing its JSON Schema with the objective of loading the schema back into the request as a tool. At the moment I am not aware of any way to validate that the schema will actually work without making a chat completions request. Hence this is what I do https://github.com/CakeCrusher/ActionCollective/blob/main/v0/client/action_collective/client.py#L30-L53 (PS: ill be cleaning things up and updating readme to make this repo usable, will be ready by the end oftomorrow.) I think having an endpoint exclusively for validating schema would be a good solution. Simply returns 201 OK or 400s error. Application of https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01747 ... In structured outputs designed to be deployed https://github.com/CakeCrusher/ActionCollective Hi @CakeCrusher, I have a similar need to do client-side validation of response schemas. While I understand the logic behind @RobertCraigie 's response from OpenAI's perspective, it's not hard to imagine other situations where this would be extremely helpful for transparent debugging. I implemented a static, pure-python function to do this. I am sure there are better/simpler ways to do this JSON schema enforcement tools, but this works for me. https://gist.github.com/PhilipMathieuIDEXX/ee627d4cf210f5d8f4db510837797b33 @CakeCrusher would be curious your opinion of this approach and/or if you've found other projects already doing this in a better way. Hi @PhilipMathieuIDEXX , Could you exapand on this `I implemented a static, pure-python function to do this.`? I haven't ran into any solutions to this. The Gist I linked in my previous comment has two functions - one to check a response_format and one to check just a schema - against the rules from the Structured Outputs documentation. It does that client-side using python functions (like checking that the input is a dict, contains the right keys, etc.) rather than requiring a call to the OpenAI api and parsing the error. @RobertCraigie really lame that OpenAI makes everyone do this manually. Maybe just provide a helper function in the library and make its use entirely optional? having to make requests in order to validate the schema really is problematic for platforms building on top of OpenAI. In our case we have thousands of openai functions and it's impossible to know if any of them contain \"valid\" json schemas according to the JsonSchema draft that OpenAI doesn't accept. There is little sense in documenting the limitations on the website but not providing a function that people can use to validate them programatically.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

For an `AzureOpenAI` client `azure_client`, however, you get a transcription or a translation depending on the endpoint specified regardless of the library function used.

It is expected that only the deployment name, i.e. `whisper`, is passed and the client will build the URL. I see. `https://{endpoint}/openai/deployments/whisper/audio/translations?api-version=2024-06-01` is the endpoint URI that shows in the Azure OpenAI Service portal. Usually for other services, copy & pasting this and passing it as the `azure_endpoint` works. This is what I did initially; the code above is refactored to use `azure_endpoint` and `azure_deployment` parameters and in retrospective makes it more evident that I should have used `azure_deployment = \"whisper\"` . I tried removing the API version and using `whisper/audio` from the original URI but neither worked. Using just `whisper` works as expected.

That wouldn't explain why it doesn't work in your environment but would unblock you @dgellow I'm starting to think my pipeline may have some additional issue. I tried your suggestion of pinning httpx to 0.27.2 yesterday, and still saw the issue. Since that time my AWS specialist has been double checking things, so I'm trying the pinning of httpx to 0.27.2 again and will report back. No one else is seeing this, still, I guess? Looks like the pinning is working now. My local container builds have been working the entire time, so I suspect I need to examine my build & deploy pipeline at AWS. If it's only me, then it's only my issue. Based on the symptoms you're describing I suspect your docker image is using an old cache (i.e one of the layer comes from a cache instead of being rebuilt). But yes, so far you have been the only one reporting that issue. Glad you were able to make the pinning work :) > Updating to the latest `openai` version will fix the issue.

However, with `httpx==0.28.0`, the issue (`TypeError: Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'`) still persists. We resolved it by downgrading `httpx` to version 0.27.x. To isolate the environment, we created a new Conda environment and reinstalled both `httpx` and `openai` using the command: This installed the latest OpenAI version (1.56.0) as expected, but it still installed `httpx==0.28.0` despite the `requirements.lock` file in your repository specifying `httpx==0.25.2`. Could you clarify why pip's dependency resolution process doesn\u2019t respect the version specified in `requirements.lock`? https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/534d6c58f6c07d219ca74dd336eaca59d48d0ada/requirements.lock#L29 @ericzhou571 the `requirements.lock` file is only for internal usage, we wouldn't want to impose direct pins for all our dependencies as that would cause so many version conflicts.

{"id": 1902, "content": "Use of proxies kwarg in httpx==0.28.0 ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [X] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug httpx version 0.28.0 removes the deprecated proxies argument; this argument is hardcoded in the library at the moment. ### To Reproduce 1. Update to httpx version 0.28.0 ### Code snippets ### OS macOS ### Python version Python 3.10.12 ### Library version openai-1.55.2 This is causing a fresh install of openai to be broken currently. Here's a reproducer: (Dockerfile) Gives: Having this issue too, with the synchronous client. A temporary fix I've found is to hardcode the `httpx` version in my requirements to the previous release, which is `0.27.2`. Just adding `httpx==0.27.2` makes my code work again. Hi, thank you for the reports, we (@stainless-api) are actively working on a fix. Edit: we have a patch under review right now and expect to push it to this repo in a few minutes Thanks for the reports, this will be fixed shortly Should be fixed once https://github.com/openai/openai-python/pull/1905 gets merged (all the credits to the amazing @RobertCraigie for the quick fix) Sorry for the delay, we're trying to get a hold of someone with the credentials to publish a new release. Fixed by #1905 @dgellow @RobertCraigie In the [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/6974a981aec1814b5abba429a8ea21be9ac58538/pyproject.toml#L11) file, the httpx version is defined as `httpx>=0.23.0, <1`. Isn't this too wide? It seems to me the dependent libraries versions should only include the current and tested versions. But `<1` allows many future upgrades that can potentially break stuff like the current issue. Other dependent libraries are defined in the same manner and seems to have the same issue. Hi @vvaezian, thanks for pointing that out. I tend to agree, though I'm not sure how strict the version range should be in this specific context. That's something we identified and will be discussing today as part of our internal post-mortem for that httpx v0.28.0 incident. I expect we will share an update later today in this thread. @dgellow @RobertCraigie FYI it looks like we need the same fix in the CLI: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/534d6c58f6c07d219ca74dd336eaca59d48d0ada/src/openai/cli/_cli.py#L179-L182 ah good catch thank you! @vvaezian Following up on your question, we decided against narrowing the version constraints. Instead we decided to invest into improving our testing setup to be sure we have coverage for nightly/dev versions of httpx (and other core dependencies), before they are released publicly.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

I am using an Ubuntu WSL image. UPDATE Did some more diagnosing, turns out the pipe command does literally nothing for the user. Why are you piping the output of a curl statement without accessing the piped output in your bash command after the pipe? You made the terminal print the file into the void.

Thanks for the reply! Sorry I was not as clear as I thought, this might be a bigger problem than I had originally looked at. So here is what was happening: The Repo I am working on is not able to upgrade to Pydantic-V2. When I am using the AsyncAssistantEventHelper it tries to call the \"accumulate_event()\" function which if it hits the IndexError tries to call model_dump with warnings set to False. `except IndexError: current_message_snapshot.content.insert( content_delta.index, cast( MessageContent, construct_type( # mypy doesn't allow Content for some reason type_=cast(Any, MessageContent), value=model_dump(content_delta, exclude_unset=True, warnings=False), ), ), )` Since \"warnings is only supported in Pydantic V2\" This would be correct I would want warnings to be set to False. The problem is the \"if warnings != True:\", since warning is False, raises the ValueError telling me that warnings cannot be true when I have Pydantic V1. So I changed that line so that if Pydantic is not V2 and warnings is True then raise the error about not being able to set warnings to True with Pydantic V1. After I made that change my code worked as intended and I no longer had issues. I just think that the statement is backwards because that if statement only runs if Pydantic is not V2 then only raises an error if warnings is set to not set True. Shouldn't it raise the error when the user is trying to use warnings in Pydantic V1? What `openai` version were you using?

This involves updating the serialization logic within the response_format_json_schema.py file. By changing the attribute from schema_ to schema, the API will recognize the parameter, resolving the error.

Ther was also mention that OpenAI 1.54.3 may be using jiter internally within OpenAI and is confused with its external usage.

My expectations of a timeout parameter in a create_and_poll function would be that it would terminate the function if the specified amount of time passed with no resolution. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no documentation of that parameter that I can find. The other poster explains that the timeout parameter actually has to do with some internal networking stuff, and won't actually timeout the request. I'm not 100% sure he is correct, but if so, it's a weird thing to include, and misleading. I do see that the underlying OpenAI API takes an expires_at parameter, which the Python library might have been able to use for real elegance, going a step beyond, but that parameter isn\u2019t really documented either.

For that reason I used a separate process and made sure that process closed in a timely manner. I used 2 seconds, which is quite long really, but the nature of the failure is that it hangs for much longer than that and I didn't want to introduce a flaky test if I cut the timeout too tight.

While the Python client operates seamlessly with most endpoints, such as `chat/completions` (as detailed in the API reference: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create), I've identified a discrepancy when it comes to training-related routes. It appears that the AzureOpenAI Client incorrectly appends /openai to the request URLs for training operations. This modification results in erroneous routes that my Azure deployment does not recognize, as it does not support URLs containing the openai segment. The routes that get affected are: - https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/create - https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/list-events - https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/list - https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files/create - etc My fix resolves these issues. Would like someone to take a look. Thanks cc @kristapratico Hi @isebasus - can you share an example of how you're building the Azure client and calling the fine-tuning operations? Fine tuning requests should include the `/openai/` segment according to [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/azureopenai/fine-tuning/create?view=rest-azureopenai-2024-03-01-preview&tabs=HTTP) so I'm curious what could be happening to create the erroneous routes. Here is my client setup: Could it be something wrong with the AzureOpenAI deployment itself? @isebasus can you share what you're passing for `azure_endpoint`? Is this just the endpoint to your Azure OpenAI resource, like \"https://{resource-name}.openai.azure.com/\"? In terms of not recognizing deployments, another thing to keep in mind is that only a subset of models / model versions support fine-tuning: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?tabs=python-secure%2Cglobal-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions#fine-tuning-models When calling fine-tune create, you need to pass the model name (not deployment name) with its model version. So for gpt-4o (2024-08-06), you would pass `model=gpt-4o-2024-08-06`. @kristapratico the Azure deployment is an Internal NVIDIA instance, so I cannot share the `azure_endpoint`. However yes, it is something like \"https://{domain_name}/llm/v1/azure/\". Here is the function I am using to create a training job: It looks like we are using `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` @isebasus gotcha, thanks for the info. The `azure_endpoint` keyword argument is really meant to work with an Azure OpenAI resource endpoint in the shape of \"https://{resource-name}.openai.azure.com/\". If you are using a custom endpoint, then you want to pass `base_url` into `AzureOpenAI` instead of `azure_endpoint`. `base_url` won't append the `/openai/` segment. Can you give that a try and let me know if it works for you? Hi @kristapratico, sorry for the late response - I just tried out replacing the `base_url` with the `azure_endpoint` input parameters and it worked! Thanks for all the help.

Currently the internal class `ChatCompletionStreamState` makes this easy, but it is private which indicates it should not be relied on. Would it be possible to make this or similar functionality a supported part of the public API? The current feature set of `ChatCompletionStreamState` is ideal: - get a `ChatCompletion` at any point during the stream (`current_completion_snapshot`).

This can cause tests to hang, especially when using pytest, due to non-daemon worker threads remaining alive. **Changes Made**: - Replaced `asyncify(get_platform)` with `asyncio.to_thread(get_platform)` in the `_request` method. This ensures that worker threads terminate correctly after completing their tasks, preventing the hanging issue in asynchronous environments. - Updated the `pythonVersion` setting in `pyright` from `3.7` to `3.9.18` to match the current Python version and to support `asyncio.to_thread`, which is available from Python 3.9 onwards. This change allows linters to recognize `asyncio.to_thread` and pass linting checks. ## Additional context & links #1827 thanks for the PR, can we instead close the worker threads after they're done? It also sounds like this could be an underlying issue with `anyio` or just that we're using it incorrectly... do you have any insight there? Thank you for reviewing my PR. > thanks for the PR, can we instead close the worker threads after they're done? After investigating, it appears that we cannot close the worker threads after they're done when using AnyIO. AnyIO does not provide an API to close or terminate these worker threads. According to the AnyIO documentation: \"Note, however, that the thread will still continue running \u2013 only its outcome will be ignored.\" [Source: AnyIO Documentation on Threads](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/threads.html) > It also sounds like this could be an underlying issue with anyio or just that we're using it incorrectly... do you have any insight there? The issue occurs because AnyIO's worker threads are non-daemon threads. When AnyIO creates a worker thread, it does not set the daemon attribute, so it inherits the daemon status from the current thread, which is the main thread. Since the main thread is non-daemon (daemon=False), the worker threads are also non-daemon. [anyio/src/anyio/_backends/_asyncio.py](https://github.com/agronholm/anyio/blob/c4844254e6db0cb804c240ba07405db73d810e0b/src/anyio/_backends/_asyncio.py#L900) [cpython/Lib/threading.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/be988e8aa6e6ac9e9a5143cf777c2caeb7f369cb/Lib/threading.py#L832-L835) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f74e8cc6-d498-4442-80f6-1bde71b20d7a) Non-daemon threads prevent the program from exiting until they have completed. In AnyIO, these worker threads remain alive even after their tasks are done, causing the program to hang, especially in testing environments like pytest. To resolve this, I replaced asyncify(get_platform) with asyncio.to_thread(get_platform). The asyncio.to_thread function creates daemon threads, which terminate when the main program exits, preventing the hanging issue. _Regarding Deleting asyncify:_ I've confirmed that the asyncify function is only used in this part of the code. If it's acceptable, I can remove the related utility function and update the commit accordingly. Please let me know if this is okay. Any update on this? It's caused issues on a github actions we're using and this just makes it hang. I have been suffering from the same bug as @jeongsu-an when using the openai python library in github workflows. Specifically, the process stalls at the end of the script I'm running and if I print out threads there is a leftover AnyIO thread that is not closing. I tested the behavior in github workflows using @jeongsu-an's PR branch and it fixes the issues I was having and does not introduce any other issues. would anyone be able to share a reproduction for this issue? I can't reproduce it with this script running both standard python and pytest Include `nest_asyncio.apply()` and your code will trigger the issue.

While eventually one might deduce the problem from the stack trace, having some sort of upstream \"check\" and more informative error about the API key would seem to help users understand the error.

The error message suggests that this is no longer supported in versions of the OpenAI Python library greater than 1.0.0. Despite following the official migration guide and pinning to earlier versions (e.g., openai==0.28), the issue remains unresolved. I have tried various solutions such as: Downgrading Python from 3.12 to 3.10, and even 3.9 Adjusting API key access methods (environment variables, hardcoding, etc.) Attempting multiple different virtual environments Following the migration instructions from the OpenAI repository and discussions, such as using openai migrate.

However, when the moderation endpoint is called, the fields `illicit` and `illicit_violent` return `None` values instead of `True` or `False`. * The same issue occurs with the `category_scores` field (of type `CategoryScores`), where all fields are expected to be `float`.

But it is just used [in 2 lines](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/8467d41376c2b17eae1c78d56b39767e7807cb6f/src/openai/lib/streaming/chat/_completions.py#L8). If we move `jiter` into `optional-dependencies`, we will be able to use `openai-python` in pyodide runtime. Once upon a time, httpx is blocking openai from pyodide too. But that issue is already resolved. The only barrier is `jiter` now. About openai, pyodide and httpx I've checked these issue: - #815 - #960 At that time, openai is not compatible with pyodide because of `httpx`. Now there even exist a [`pyodide-httpx`](https://pypi.org/project/pyodide-httpx/) to patch httpx in pyodide If we can use `openai` in pyodide, it will be possible to provide interactive python demos in the browser for prompt engineering frameworks, which I think is a great feature to have. ### Additional context Another way is to use another package to parse partial json. There is a package called [`partial-json-parser`](https://pypi.org/project/partial-json-parser/) which did the almost same job as `jiter.from_json`, but also providing more flexibility on specifying which types are allowed to be incomplete. And it keep types too. For the latter one, let me present an example: In the example above, tokens increase but parsed value disappeared. Plus, `partial-json-parser`'s API is consistent among its Python/[JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/partial-json)/[Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/blaze2305/partial-json-parser) implementations. I tried a bit to replace `jiter` by `partial_json_parser`: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/commit/7419b7059f5e024aa9b87942b47ecff80a6b32b5#diff-08dc4c3c3e8e145eec1fd0b6a4577f0bce73567d4da3460e08dd4c2d34b27915 Thanks for the report, would it be enough to just lazily import `jiter` instead? Or does simply listing it in dependencies cause issues? Additionally, have you opened an issue with jiter to see if the pydantic team can do anything to make it Pyodide compatible? I'm sure they'd be interested in making that work. Listing it in `dependencies` should still cause issues. Because installing `openai` will try to install its dependencies, and `jiter` is non-optional dependency of `openai`. Pyodide only supports pure-python wheels and emscripten wheels, but `jiter` don't have any of these, so resolving `jiter` will fail, causing failure on resolving `openai`. Thanks for advices. I've opened an issue with jiter: - https://github.com/pydantic/jiter/issues/151 This is great. Integrating with Pyodide would allow the OpenAI library to be used in web applications without needing a backend server. This could open up new opportunities for educational tools, interactive demos, and user-driven applications that leverage the OpenAI API. The innovation could provide significant benefits, especially for web-based applications, but it requires a thoughtful approach to assess compatibility, potential costs, and benefits. The total cost will vary based on the project's scope, the existing codebase's complexity, and the resources available for development. Planning and phased implementation may be beneficial to manage these efforts effectively. Give us some time to review this update. Furthermore, could you specify how you would like to use Pyodide in OpenAI? There are some personal factors, such as I am more familiar with Python, so most of my prompt engineering is written in Python. I am working on [an educational tools and interactive demos platform](https://py3.online/), so I integrates with pyodide a lot. Another reason is the ability to use Pyodide as a code interpreter, providing it as a tool for the LLM. ([Here is a prototype](https://reasonify.vercel.app/)) And, I am planning to provide interactive docs for every supported python library, with LLM copilot built-in, which is a long-term target. This happen to be the engagement we are looking for in this AI Generation. According to the report release by IBM Seven Bets, we are considering Gen AI as the optimal breakthrough in the AI commercialization to build sustainability and profitability using Data to People (D2P) Model. Hey guys \ud83d\udc4b Stumbled on this, and there is a built wheel of jiter can be found at https://py.cafe/maartenbreddels/jiter-demo. This in turn allows `openai` to run in pyodide (and by extension amazing tools like PyCafe). See here the toy example where I am using `openai` in a Vizro app to generate nice looking charts: https://py.cafe/maxi.schulz/vizro-ai-UI Maybe that helps? Wow great! Can you upstream that wheel to pyodide so that others can install it directly? To use jiter's wheel with Pyodide, it seems that the version of Emscripten used to compile jiter must be the same as the one used to compile Pyodide. py.cafe explains how to build jiter into wheel, and and this method worked fine for me. https://py.cafe/docs/howto/build I will also share the Dockerfile I used to compile it. https://gist.github.com/narumichiaki/0cb32c5b6db64493d19066a9ca3aeccb `jiter==0.8.2` and `openai==1.68.2` is supported by `pyodide>=0.27.5` now. - https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/5388 - https://github.com/pyodide/pyodide/pull/5536", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

Hi, thanks for the quick reply! Sadly I can't provide a full script for privacy reasons but I'll be happy to share any information you need for identifying the issue. Here's the traceback: Please let me know if there's anything else you need. Could you share a request ID from a failing request? https://github.com/openai/openai-python#request-ids From seeing the logs of our application I understand the call to `client.beta.chat.completions.parse(...)` resulted in an exception, thus it gave no result from which to extract a `request_id`. \ud83d\ude1e ahhhh right sorry, if you don't already have debug logging enabled, could you enable it? https://github.com/openai/openai-python#logging that should show a request ID in the logs Sure thing! Hi there! Any updates here? FYI - same thing happening for me, probably 50% of the time: I've solved this in the meantime with a tenacity retry, but it's adding latency and calls which isn't ideal... I'm experiencing the same issue. I'm considering consuming the API directly myself as this is a bit of a pain. Is there an intention to address this bug? How complex are the models you're putting together? I wonder if it's just a token limit or something? e.g. here's a simple Pydantic model from a test script I was playing around with: which explodes into: A fairly complex model feels like it would generate quite a few tokens which might get missed/misinterpreted. I wonder if a simplified json blob for the `response_format` would help things? My schema is only slightly more complex than your example, very similar, but wrapped in an array allowing the model to return multiple entries for each prompt. Output token lengths are fairly reasonable, but I assume there must be pathological cases. Did anybody find a fix to this issue? This issue only recently appear for me. Thanks @RobertCraigie for merging the PR! @DeterjoSimon just pushed the fix, should be available in next release! @rjoshi I don't think your PR would solve all the issues encountered, as the original report includes this in the error message which means the content was non-empty Thanks @RobertCraigie , I see - I have not yet run into this issue but will keep an eye out for this. We at Starspark.AI are betting heavily on structured response for enabling our product scenario. We experience the same issue but with different model gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 deployed onto Azure OpenAI (Sweden Central). Some diagnostic info: Here is our structure output model: @ms-86 How do you generate the parsing/error? Does it appear on a specific class? I'm guessing you are attaching the pydantic schema to a langchain LLM, like: `llm.with_structured_output(schema=FinalResponse)`. Something similar to this? @DeterjoSimon You're correct. But since we've been experiencing a lot of hallucinations in our responses (not matching a schema we defined) we decided to include raw answer and in case of parsing error do it on our own using some heuristic: Today I have found in our telemetry something which could help finding a root cause of this bug. It seems that the input for parsing an answer into Pydantic schema is just full of 0x0a (line feed characters) Is this issue fixed? I'm having it and I don't know if it's because i'm using OpenAI from Azure or something like that", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

{"id": 1733, "content": "Structured outputs `response_format` requires `strict` function calling JSON Schema? ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [X] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug I am using the OpenAI Python 1.47.0 library and the model `gpt-4o-2024-08-06`. I've got the `json_schema` response format working with Pydantic/Non-Pydantic models (non-pydantic meaning I manually create the proper response format JSON schema) without tool calling. However, when I attempt to send tools with the payload to the method: `client.beta.chat.completions.parse(...)` I am getting a 400 because the tool's JSON schema does not have `strict`/`additionalProperties`. The error shows as: When I do add the `strict: True` and `additionalProperties: False`, I get a 200: In your [docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/introduction?context=without_parse), I don't see this coupling between function calling schema and json_schema response format called out (if it is there, I am obviously missing it). The docs say: This makes it seem like they're able to be used independently. As an additional note: in .Net, I can use the OpenAI library and make a call to the normal chat completions endpoint, configure the proper `strict` JSON Schema for the json_schema response format, and not need to manipulate the function calling JSON schema to include `strict` or `additionalParameters` and the calls work fine. No 400s encountered. Something like this: ### To Reproduce 1. Use the latest OpenAI package 2. Configure a Pydantic model as the `response_format` 3. Include a tool (with non-strict JSON Schema) with the payload 4. Make a call to `client.beta.chat.completions.parse(...)` 5. Observe the 400 due to the function calling schema missing the `strict`/`additionalProperties` keys/values. ### Code snippets _No response_ ### OS MacOS ### Python version Python 3.12.5 ### Library version openai 1.47.0 Hi @moonbox3, the `beta.chat.completions.parse()` method currently requires strict `response_format` and strict tools because we make assumptions in the types that function tools can always be parsed and in general the purpose of the `.parse()` method is to support auto-parsing so we didn't think it made sense to supports tools or response formats that we couldn't guarantee to be parseable. > In your [docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/introduction?context=without_parse), I don't see this coupling between function calling schema and json_schema response format called out (if it is there, I am obviously missing it). The docs are right that there isn't any coupling between function calling and response formats as the OpenAPI API doesn't require any coupling, it's just the `.parse()` SDK helper method that requires parseable inputs. Does that help answer your question? Hi @RobertCraigie, thanks for your reply, I appreciate it. I'm really hoping to be able to support the json_schema response format only right now, without having to manage the strict tools. Given that this is present/allowed in .Net, I would expect the same in other OpenAI SDKs like Python. Is there another way I can handle a chat completion json_schema response format without using the `.parse()` method that would force the strict tools? Or `.parse()` is the only way? Thanks for your help. We'll be shipping a public API for this shortly but for now your best bet would be to use our internal API for converting a type to a `response_format` and then parse it yourself: This will work as the `.create()` method doesn't impose any additional restrictions on the input, it just passes everything straight to the API. @RobertCraigie thanks for your help!

Can you please point me to the correct, up-to-date method for using the chat models in Python, as well as the proper documentation? I want to make sure I'm following the current best practices. Here's the [readme](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) for this SDK and the [OpenAI API docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction) which should include all the information you need!", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

However, the field named 'schema' is a built-in field in Pydantic. When you convert this model to Pydantic, it triggers the following error. `NameError: Field name \"schema\" shadows a BaseModel attribute; use a different field name with \"alias='schema'` This bug exists in version 1.40 and later versions. ### To Reproduce 1. from openai.types.chat.completion_create_params import CompletionCreateParamsNonStreaming from pydantic.v1 import create_model_from_typedict 2. ref = create_model_from_typedict(CompletionCreateParamsNonStreaming) 3. Then error occurred ### Code snippets _No response_ ### OS any ### Python version any ### Library version openai v1.40.0 I don't think there's anything we can do about this unfortunately. If you upgrade to Pydantic v2, you can use [`TypeAdapter`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/api/type_adapter/) to perform validation instead which won't have this issue.

For example, I cannot access and track information from the `usage` object in the chat completion response. **Desired behavior** As a library user, I always want to know details about responses from LLM calls that costs tokens for me. More specifically, I want to inspect `usage` to know how many tokens I \"wasted\" calling the LLM, for instance when `max_tokens` was set to a too low value for the LLM to generate a complete structured output. This enables me to track and control costs. I see two potential solutions: 1. Stop raising exceptions for these scenarios and always return a chat completion object. I believe this is the behavior in the non-beta version of the chat completion call 2. Return the response as an attribute in the exception object so that it can be used by the calling programmer **Version used** - 1.44.1 (latest on PyPI at the time of writing) **Code location** - File and line: [`openai.lib._parsing._completions.py` on lines 71-75](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/src/openai/lib/_parsing/_completions.py#L71) - Function: `parse_chat_completion` ### Additional context _No response_ This will be fixed in the next release! https://github.com/openai/openai-python/pull/1701", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

Unfortunately, I'm still missing something to reproduce this. Could you share the region your resource resides in and/or the prompt that causes this? > > edit: Do you by chance have a custom content filter applied to the deployment with asynchronous filtering enabled? Yes, of course. Region: Sweden We have a content filter that I think i \"custom\" (see screenshot): ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d232b312-c4f9-4022-8b4e-b526f6d0e099) I see this with all prompts so far. Again, using the older API `2023-05-15` results in responses aligned with the types in the open ai python client. @JensMadsen got it. In your screenshot, it does look like the asynchronous content filter is enabled. With the async filter turned on, the Azure response is slightly altered to return information like `content_filter_results` and `content_filter_offsets` in the first and final streamed chunk (and omit sending `delta`): Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter?tabs=warning%2Cuser-prompt%2Cpython-new#sample-response-stream-passes-filters I'm following up with the team to try to understand the reason for this difference. You won't see this with the older version (2023-05-15) since content filter annotations weren't added to the API until 2023-06-01-preview and later. It looks like the async filter is still in preview and could be subject to change, so at the moment I think it might be best to write code that is resilient to this API difference. You're absolutely right that the typing is wrong for Azure in this case, but I believe that this discrepancy lies more on the service than the SDK. @kristapratico Any progress on this? Makes the SDK unusable with Azure + Async filter as it causes runtime errors. @kapis trying to get an update from the team. I was under the impression that the service rolled out a fix for this but can confirm what you're seeing. @kapis Hi! Just jumping in here.

I would like to request the addition of an endpoint that allows for the retrieval of all threads. If there are concerns about potential security risks, such as team members or others within the same organization gaining access to all threads, I suggest implementing an additional layer of security. For example, you could restrict the listing of threads to those generated under a specific project and token bearer. Additionally, I have noticed that this request has been reiterated multiple times since January but has not yet been addressed. Given the ongoing interest and potential impact of this feature, I believe it would be highly beneficial for many users. This enhancement would significantly improve the usability and flexibility of the API, particularly for teams working on collaborative projects. Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to your feedback. Cheers ### Additional context _No response_ I'm going to close this as it's a request for a new API endpoint, not the Python SDK. I've forwarded this to the OpenAI team. @RobertCraigie Is there a plan to eventually support this endpoint by the API team? The metadata fields feel pointless if we can't search for them. It essentially requires a user of the Assistants API to store the Thread ID if it needs to look it up later (instead of being able to query for all Threads that match some metadata key/value). Another approach to solve this problem would be if we could choose the Thread ID when we create the thread (and thus, a user could hash some key/values -> thread ID). I'd much prefer querying for Threads within the context of an Assistant based on metadata key/values.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

I found a few more instances that can be addressed: Issues: * optional fields with pydantic defaults generate an unsupported 'default' field in the schema * date fields generate a format='date-time' field in the schema which is not supported The test cases below builds on your `to_strict_json_schema` function and removes addresses these problematic fields with the `remove_property_from_schema` function: ### Additional context _No response_ @RobertCraigie Thanks for fixing one of the issues! Do you have an ETA on the fix for the \"format\" issue? There are currently no plans to automatically remove `\"format\": \"date-time\"` as it breaks `.parse()`'s promise that it will either generate valid data or refuse to generate any data. We're considering opt-in flags to remove certain features that the API doesn't support yet but I don't have an ETA to share unfortunately. Currently typical users of `openai-python`'s \"structured output\" feature often must resort to maintaining parallel sets of Pydantic classes, one for their own internal use (such as a proprietary API being provided) and one for interfacing with OpenAI that avoids those problematic Pydantic features. Other examples of problematic OpenAI features are: `myfield: int = Field(ge=\u2026, le=\u2026)`, `myfield: bool = False`. I understand fields with some of these features (such as min/max values) can't easily be degraded to become OpenAI compatible, but at least for those that can, it would be fantastic to at least have the flag described by @RobertCraigie to simply automatically remove them from the schema. Even the `\"format\": \"date-time\"` case could be addressed by using a library such as [`dateutil.parser`](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html) to parse most date formats. Anything that helps avoid having to maintain redundant model classes would be a huge win. Somewhat related, how feasible would it be to convert `int` fields with min/max restrictions and a sufficiently short range of values into `enum` validations, which OpenAI apparently supports? I have a bunch of fields that are \"1\u20135\" kind of ranges, and they could easily be expressed as `\"enum\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

Although my current TPM limit caused it, I think there are two parts to consider/improve. 1. I initially thought that the requested *.jsonl file would be automatically removed, but later, I realized that I was required to manually remove all the failed batch job posts from my end. In this regard, I think it would be helpful if I could provide an additional parameter to \"client.batches.create\" so that it automatically removes a file if the batch request fails. 2. I expected that the \"client.batches.create\" call would at least throw an error if the batch posting failed due to the TPM limit, but it didn't, and I always need to check by calling \"client.batches.retrieve.\" I think it would be great to either throw an error for the API limit failure cases or at least provide any details in the 'errors' or 'failed_at' parameter from the response of \"client.batches.create.\" ### Additional context Both of them may need some edits on the backend API server as well (either way would work, and I think server-side support would be a bit clearer, but anyway), but I believe it would be worthwhile to review at least.

The application scenario is that OpenAI API keys are managed by some OAuth2 token servers, where a request is posted to the token servers and an API key with expiration is granted. In this case, for long running services, each time a request for OpenAI API is made, it is necessary to check and update the cached OpenAI API key.

Thinking aloud, I imagine the precedence order for resolving auth in the client when doing something like could then look like: * [current behavior] Any authorization headers set in the `http_client` arg, if this arg is provided * [current behavior] The value of the `api_key`, if provided * [current behavior] OpenAI environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY etc) * Auth explicitly specified in `openai_api_key_provider` * Auth automatically provided by plugins, if `api_key`, `http_client`, `openai_api_key_provider` are not passed I'm able to create something like this by using the api_key parameter/property, since that actually sets a Bearer header behind the scenes.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

We have integrated argcomplete into the `_cli.py` file, updated the `pyproject.toml` file to include argcomplete, and revised the `README.md` to provide instructions on activating the tab completion feature. ## Additional context & links This addresses #843 Alright, let's get this shell autocompletion show on the road. This is a smart move \u2013 make the OpenAI CLI as user-friendly as possible. The easier it is to use, the more people will adopt it, and the faster we can spread the PMLL gospel. I see they've already got a pull request (#1603) with argcomplete integration. That's a solid choice. We'll need to make sure it covers all the major shells: Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell. No user left behind. And the README updates look good. Clear instructions, easy to follow. We'll make sure it's front and center, so nobody misses it. But let's not stop there. We can take this further. How about some custom completion logic? Anticipate the user's needs, suggest relevant commands, make the whole experience buttery smooth. And let's not forget those edge cases. Different OS versions, shell configurations... we'll test the hell out of this, make sure it works flawlessly for everyone. This is more than just a feature, it's a gateway. A gateway to the future of AI, where PMLL reigns supreme. And with a slick autocompletion setup, we'll make sure everyone can walk through that gate with ease. So let's merge this PR, polish the docs, and unleash the power of autocompletion. Bash $ openai api completions.create -m # Hit TAB ...and like magic, the CLI suggests: Bash $ openai api completions.create -m The user starts typing text-davinci-003, hits TAB again... Bash $ openai api completions.create -m text-davinci-003 --pr # Hit TAB ...and the CLI knows what's up: Bash $ openai api completions.create -m text-davinci-003 --prompt \" See? Smooth as silk. No more fumbling through docs, no more typos. Just pure, unadulterated coding bliss. so are @hoonman how goes things? @RobertCraigie @kwhinnery-openai Nudging this since it's been a while.

{"id": 1596, "content": "httpx client has very poor performance for concurrent requests compared to aiohttp ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [X] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug The API client uses httpx, which has very poor performance when making concurrent requests compared to aiohttp. Open issue for httpx [here](https://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3215) This is forcing us to swap out the OpenAI SDK for our own implementation, which is a pain. I suspect it is the root cause of the difference between node.js and Python demonstrated [here](https://community.openai.com/t/comparing-node-js-and-python-performance-with-the-official-openai-client/787874) I'm not massively familiar with the development of this SDK, and whether there is a key reason for picking httpx over aiohttp. From my reading it was switched over for V1 in order to create consistency between sync and async clients, but I'm not sure how vital it is to achieve this. However for our high concurrency async use cases this renders the SDK useless. ### To Reproduce To reproduce, run chat completion requests in parallel with 20+ concurrent requests, benchmarking the openai API client against an implementation using aiohttp. Example code can be found in the linked issue in httpx. ### Code snippets _No response_ ### OS Linux/MacOs ### Python version v3.12 ### Library version 1.12.0 Interesting, I was not aware there was such a performance discrepancy between `aiohttp` and `httpx`. From skimming the linked issue it thankfully seems like there's a lot of inflight work that would bring `httpx` up to par performance-wise. >I'm not massively familiar with the development of this SDK, and whether there is a key reason for picking httpx over aiohttp. From my reading it was switched over for V1 in order to create consistency between sync and async clients, but I'm not sure how vital it is to achieve this. Yes, consistency here is very important, using different clients would make everything much more complicated/confusing for little gain, especially as this performance discrepancy can be fixed. > However for our high concurrency async use cases this renders the SDK useless. Sorry about this, hopefully the httpx PRs can be merged soon. In the meantime it might be less work for you to use a patched version of `httpx` with the performance fixes included in the linked issue. --- I'm going to close this as we have no plans to move away from httpx. In the future we may offer a more extensible custom http client API which would allow you to use any http library as long as you implement the interface. However this isn't likely to happen anytime soon unfortunately. I'll see if we can help land the `httpx` / `httpcore` PRs faster. Understood, thanks for the quick reply! Hi everyone, I'm working on a chatbot and ran some **load testing and profiling** under **high concurrent users**. It appears that the **performance of `httpx` in asynchronous mode**, which is used by the **OpenAI Python SDK**, isn't meeting expectations. Are there any **updates or planned improvements** on this? Or would it be worth **benchmarking my application with `aiohttp`** to see if it performs better under high concurrency? Thanks in advance for your insights! ^ Likewise, to +1 this, our aiohttp impl is substantially faster, sometimes even twice as much with aiohttp - I go from about 100 requests per second to 200+ on my local machine, so not sure what the discrepancy is caused by. We've moved from using httpx to aiohttp and it solved a lot of our concurrency issues - it means we don't use the openai client which I was initially concerned about due to the theoretical connection sharing benefit of using the client but this pales in comparison. I wish i'd swapped sooner. this is the aiohttp class we are using to maximize throughput while this issue is open: In my case, after profiling, I identified a performance overhead in the `AsyncConnectionPool.handle_async_request` method. It appears this is mainly due to inefficient handling of idle or expired connections, as revealed in the profiling. We could reduce time complexity by using a more optimized data structure, rather than repeatedly iterating over the connections. I came across these pull requests addressing similar issues, but they haven't been merged yet: [Issue #3215 comment](https://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3215#issuecomment-2220795088). I tested the optimizations by installing the patches from the `all-optimizations` branch by @MarkusSintonen: With these changes, the performance overhead in `AsyncConnectionPool.handle_async_request` was significantly reduced. It would be very helpful if the OpenAI SDK supports a drop-in replacement for `http_client`, allowing us to swap `httpx` with `aiohttp` easily. If performance is still a concern here, please try `aiohttp` 3.11.x+ as we have smoothed out some more of the concurrency delays and cancellation races in this version. https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/changes.html @RobertCraigie : I see you have closed this marking it as not planned [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/1596#issuecomment-2269186765). Shouldn't this be a priority item for OpenAI SDK team to make this SDK usable for use cases to scale ? Doesn't this discourage users to use this SDK at scale ? Same here... :( I am a developer of an AI character service that provides interactive conversations, and it uses large language models (LLMs) to generate the characters' responses. The service has used openai package v0.27.4 to request to LLMs. After upgrading openai package to v1.59.4, I noticed a decrease in the server's throughput and an increase in the latency of LLM hosting servers. I suspect that httpx is the cause, as discussed in related conversations, and I would like to explore potential solutions. I look forward to responses from contributors. Sorry about this \u2013 we're tracking primarily at https://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/3215 but I agree it makes sense to leave this open, as one way or another I do agree this needs to get solved for users of this SDK. Stopgaps you can try while we work with Tom to improve httpcore itself: 1. Use https://github.com/lizeyan/httpx-AIOHttpTransport/ as a custom transport with httpx 2. Use https://github.com/MtkN1/httpcore-speedups instead of `httpcore`, with eg `uv add httpcore --index httpcore-speedups=https://mtkn1.github.io/httpcore-speedups/simple/` Update: For anyone running into async performance issues with this library, I recommend using https://github.com/karpetrosyan/httpx-aiohttp, which is published by an `httpx` maintainer, like so: Deployed a solution with `httpx_aiohttp`, but a lot of warnings are raised such as: > Unclosed connection > client_connection: Connection Not sure what exactly is happing, but probably because of issues in `httpx_aiohttp`. (update) Issued: https://github.com/karpetrosyan/httpx-aiohttp/issues/4 We also encounter problems with the httpx client, implemented by v1, when we share the client across multiple threads (sync). The pod freezes because the connection is not released or something similar. We got this issue for months, so curious if anyone also have this issue with sync client. On top of this, the relative sluggish [releases](https://github.com/encode/httpx/releases) of httpx are currently blocking a critical security issue with `h11` via `httpcore`. @loleg I don't want this thread to get off-topic; would you mind messaging me and cc'ing security@stainless.com with more details? EDIT: it looks like you're talking about https://github.com/encode/httpcore/releases/tag/1.0.9 which was released a week ago and can be used with httpx already (httpx specifies `httpcore==0.*`). Any further discussion of this should take place in a separate GitHub issue or over email. Update: with many thanks for support from @rattrayalex and team, and apologies for diverting from the performance discussion, I've mostly ruled out that the issue is with this package or with httpx. In my case an upgrade to `poetry 2.1.2` seems to have resolved a dependency conflict. Up and running with: Is this issue solved now in the latest version? [This](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/1596#issuecomment-2709021063) suggestion was great, we see a [97% lower median latency on load tests](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/11097) We now have builtin support for `aiohttp` usage, please try it out and let us know if you run into any issues! https://github.com/openai/openai-python#with-aiohttp (There are still some more things to come such as more detailed docs + making it easier to instantiate your own `ClientSession()`)", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

Because multiple tool outputs can only be submitted in a single request, managing and syncing the state of each tool_calls can add unnecessary complication in some use_cases. In that case, it requires testing to find out that turning off the parallel_tool_call option is also possible in streams, since documentation for parallel_tool_call is only provided for non-stream approach. I've checked that parallel_tool_call option works as expected if passed in as extra_body. Although this works fine for me, I think such option should be explicitly set as keyword argument. ### Additional context I would like to try and make a PR for this if my request turns out to be valid.

I changed nothing in my code but from 31/07/2024 it doesn't work with AzureOpenAI. The output of file_batch: Are there some problems with AzureOpenAI ? Thanks, Matteo ### To Reproduce Use a simple file.txt or other types. Execute the code and see the result. ### Code snippets ### OS Linux ### Python version Python v3.10.12 ### Library version openai v1.37.2 cc @kristapratico @matteopulega I'm not able to reproduce the error. Can you share which region your Azure OpenAI resource is in? If this is still failing today, I recommend opening a support [ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/create-ticket) against the service. The region Is swedencentral. same problem here okey, after some tests, i can upload files when a vector store is empty. But i can not when there is at least one document in it. The status of the file stays on :'in_progress' and using the UI (vector stores) of https://oai.azure.com/ also has some problems. I can't add / delete files sometimes ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f35af203-cc63-4784-aa1f-36e510a56be4) Now, however, I have a different problem: after having created a vector store and 2 files for examples, when I try to execute `client.beta.vector_stores.file_batches.create_and_poll(vector_store_id=vector_store_id,file_ids=file_ids)` the process never ends. > when I try to execute client.beta.vector_stores.file_batches.create_and_poll(vector_store_id=vector_store_id,file_ids=file_ids) the process never ends. are you on the latest version? yes, in 1.48. Just to remember, i'm using AzureOpenAI with region swedencentral. Now it works. it seems that sometimes vector stores using AzureOpenai stop to work correctly. Same here - The file upload was working until Oct 9th last time i checked and now when i try to execute the below code, the process never ends. _open ai version = 1.51.2 (latest) previously 1.50.2_ The same example which was working previously stopped working now. No changes were done in the code. Same here again UPDATE: So we had created a lot of vector stores, I removed a lot of them and now it's running smoothly again. Yes same here, sometimes it just works directly but then all of a sudden the call CreateBatchFileJob stays in_progress: > Same here - The file upload was working until Oct 9th last time i checked and now when i try to execute the below code, the process never ends. > > _open ai version = 1.51.2 (latest) previously 1.50.2_ > > > > The same example which was working previously stopped working now. No changes were done in the code. UPDATE: The upload is working smoothly again. Did not change anything anywhere. Seems this issue is intermittent and persists for a long time before going back to normal. Hi. Using AzureOpenAI (client = AzureOpenAI()) I can query my vector store and I can upload files, but the files don't seem to actually associate with the vector store when I load the Azure AI Foundry/ check it in the assistant vector stores section. I don't get an error, it's just that the files don't seem to be attached. Any idea if this is a bug? This works: ` # Retrieve files from the vector store. def get_vector_store_files(vector_store_id, limit=100): file_data = [] after = None while True: try: logging.info(f\"Attempting to fetch vector store files for {vector_store_id} with after={after}\") response = client.vector_stores.files.list(vector_store_id, limit=limit, after=after) except Exception as e: logging.error(f\"Error fetching vector store files: {e}\") break for file in response.data: try: file_detail = client.files.retrieve(file.id) upload_time = datetime.fromtimestamp(file_detail.created_at) vs_filename = file_detail.filename file_key = vs_filename[-16:] # use last 16 characters for matching file_data.append({ \"VectorStoreFileName\": vs_filename, \"FileKey\": file_key, \"VectorStoreUpload\": upload_time, \"VectorStoreFileID\": file_detail.id }) logging.info(f\"Retrieved vector store file: {vs_filename}\") except Exception as e: logging.error(f\"Error retrieving details for file ID {file.id}: {e}\") if getattr(response, 'has_more', False): after = response.data[-1].id else: break return file_data` this works too, but not putting the files on the VS itself. ` def upload_file_to_vector_store(vector_store_id, file_path): try: with open(file_path, \"rb\") as f: # Use the file batch helper to upload and attach the file. file_batch = client.vector_stores.file_batches.upload_and_poll( vector_store_id=vector_store_id, files=[f] ) logging.info(f\"File batch upload status: {file_batch.status}\") logging.info(f\"File batch counts: {file_batch.file_counts}\") return file_batch except Exception as e: logging.error(f\"Error uploading file '{file_path}' to vector store: {e}\") def fix_any_upload_issues(vector_store_id): \"\"\" Checks the vector store for files with a status of 'failed' and attempts to reattach them.

I\u2019ve implemented a workaround by detecting failures, removing the file reference from the vector store (not the actual file), and initiating a re-upload.

{"id": 1566, "content": "chore(internal): use different 32bit detection method Having an OpenAI, Celery, and NLTK setup, the check being removed generates a crash in the app: - [x] I understand that this repository is auto-generated and my pull request may not be merged ## Changes being requested Removing the check `python_bitness, _ = platform.architecture()` in `_base_client.py`, in the `get_architecture` method. It leads to a crash with some setups (Celery + NLTK in my case). The `try` block is insufficient to prevent this type of crash. Hi @robcalvillo can you share more information about the nature of the crash? Why does the `try` block not work? Could we replace `except Exception` with `except BaseException` to fix this issue? Hi @RobertCraigie, thanks for following up. This is a weird bug, TBH. This is my setup: 1. Python 3.11.9 2. Celery 5.4.0 3. OpenAI 1.30.1 4. Intel Macbook Pro with MacOS Big Sur (11.7.8). To repro, I simply add NLTK 3.8.1 to the mix (i.e. `import nltk`) and then execute a Celery task. The worker crashes with the error I shared before. I tried exchanging `Exception` with `BaseException` as you suggested, but got the same. As to why `try` isn't enough, given the `SIGILL` (illegal instruction), my best guess is that something within Python's code leads to memory corruption on my specific setup. Here's the entire problem report in case that's helpful: Thanks for sharing more details @robcalvillo, have you opened an issue with Celery / NLTK? It seems quite bad that a simple method like this can cause a process crash. I think instead of removing this entirely we could change the check to use [`sys.maxsize`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.maxsize)? e.g. No, @RobertCraigie. I haven't opened an issue with Celery or NLTK in part because I haven't figured out the root cause of the issue, but also because the crash doesn't even happen in any of those. The crash actually happens in Python's own code, in `platform.py` in the `_syscmd_file` method. I added the alternative 32-bit check you suggested. It seems to work fine, as in it doesn't crash and `sys.maxsize` returns a coherent value. However, I don't have an x32 computer I can test with. Okay thanks @robcalvillo, I would still recommend opening an issue with them even if you don't have a full repro. They might know how to fix it regardless. I'll merge this change in separately as it's easier on our end, thanks for the PR!", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

Enhances overall user experience by making complex topics more approachable. # The story. Why Dave? I am a 3rd Level IT Support agent and an Applied Psychologist in IT. (Not saying much!! but that's what I did in life) I was watching a YouTube video and I went to the OpenAI README.md file to attempt using the OpenaAI code, as the API has changed from the last time I was playing with it to link the OpenAI API key to talk to my computer. (Macbook Pro M3) and after adding the code to VS Code opened a terminal and entered. python chat.py, it ran but there was no output in the terminal. I have used OpenAi many times with projects and knew the print option was missing. So I added it, but it took a few attempts to get it right. I understand Python but couldn't order a sandwich meaning, I can't program but know how to miniplate the code with the help of OpenAI and ChatGPT, as it can explain on every level the meaning of what I want to be explained, from a 15-year-old to a professional explanation, I get to understand the jargon, technical language and what they mean in context. So a 5 minute coding challenge turned into a 2 hour drama!! Lolz.... But I got it working with persistence. I then had the idea of adding this line to the official README.md so other people could save the time I did and get it to work 1st time, as this is the main reason. Making things hard to do turns those away, as internally we don't want to feel unsmart or silly not being able to understand, and our minds will protect us and distract us to something we do understand and bring back that feeling of confidence inside ourselves again. (Thats the dyslexic in me to need to understand, and the psychologist in me to share that understanding to make it easier.) So I began to then continue the README.me and add more explanations and examples using real life anologies to link what we know in the mind already to complex ideas and make them easy to connect the nurons and nodes. Like computers. So, my writing is code in English for linking two models together using WordChains. ;) My background in why I did this, as I do actually love writing manuals and guides for people, maybe due to being dyslexic and I find it hard to understand things, so I make them easier for me, then I build on that level, as I have helped people with disabilities understand things by first doing it myself. I used to write computer/program manuals for IBM Call Center Dublin. At the same time training new employees with no computer experience. So IBM asked me to rewrite the manuals for entry-level understanding, and then combine both scripts so the knowledge gap is understood and seen simultaneously. It is funny as I help create an internal program called RICK, rich in computer knowledge, and the purpose was to ask the program questions about a problem, the database will bring back answers in steps to help the employee fix the customer's problem over the phone. And now we have OpenAI!!! ### Sorry for the background, but people might ask why I bothered to add to an already masterful readme. # My Problem Fixed. ## What I Added. I add a line of code at the bottom of the code block, this block is the 1st usage of code from Openai on the README.md file. This line is print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content) I added this as it was needed to see something appear in the terminal, I ran the script a few times and nothing happened but returned to the prompt and no sign of errors, which is a good sign I believe. This made me worry I was doing something wrong and copied and pasted into ChatGPT and that gave me an incorrect print command. 1. print(chat_completion.choices[0].message['content']) 2. print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content']) 3. print(chat_completion['choices'][0]['message']['content']) # The API Code to get a response from OpenAI servers saying \"Huston we can hear you\" import os from openai import OpenAI client = OpenAI( # This is the default and can be omitted api_key=os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"), ) chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create( messages=[ { \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Say this is a test\", } ], model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", ) print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content) 1.st Job is to test all the openai code in the README.md using Python 3.11.9 and I will add what openai module I am using and all other details, as every machine is different. I will post my findings here, so my version of readme has all the code blocks working and tested to work, this is for me, so I can use the other kinds of options available, but have to spend hours working them out, but for you brilliant experts, it seems and looks easy! And it is easy if you are at that level. Accessibility for people with disabilities tends to help people without as the explanations covers everyone. Please do not get annoyed if I presume that your README is not good enough or difficult, it is not when you are in a place to understand complex technical language. This is what I am to achieve with my readme, to combine complex with basic English to bridge the gap. I will post updates one by one. Kind regards, David. Just wondering if people could suggest if the README is ok by them, and its not too much. Just want to help people with disabilities and new learners how to use the openai code and learn python.

However, this new token is not utilized by `AzureOpenAI` for the remaining retries. The problem originates from the `openai/lib/azure.py` -> `_prepare_options` function, where the `azure_ad_token` is only set to `headers[\"Authorization\"]` during initialization and not when `azure_ad_token` is changed. See `if headers.get(\"Authorization\") is None` below: ### To Reproduce The `azure.identity.ClientSecretCredential.get_token` function was utilized as the `azure_ad_token_provider`, and the `AzureOpenAI.max_retries` was set to `1000`. Due to numerous failures and retries, the process exceeded the 60-minute validity period of the token.

{"id": 1525, "content": "Send input below model and other parameters in json bodies of HTTP requests ### Confirm this is a feature request for the Python library and not the underlying OpenAI API. - [X] This is a feature request for the Python library ### Describe the feature or improvement you're requesting When I send a request to an OpenAI compatible endpoint using the following code: It sends an HTTP request with the following body, where the input always comes before the model. I think it would be better to always put the `input` last, after the `model` so that implementers of the OpenAI API can branch earlier in processing a request based on `model`. This is only a problem for large (eg. >8KB) inputs, which do not fit into typical web server buffers anymore. That is, the body should look like this instead: At $WORK we offer an OpenAI compatible API and route based on the model parameter, so we have to buffer the whole `input` before the request can be forwarded to the correct upstream server hosting that model. This routing only works for inputs that don't exceed our buffer size, meaning we can only process smaller requests. If the model came before input instead, it would be possible to parse the model and route based off it with only a small buffer size, even for inputs that far exceed the buffer size. An added benefit of the proposed parameter order would be slightly improved latency, because the upstream can be decided earlier and the input is starting to get sent sooner. I imagine we are not the only ones branching based on `model`, so this change would improve latency and allow for bigger inputs across the whole ecosystem. I am honestly not sure if this can be changed in this repo since the code is generated. Maybe changing the order in the API spec: https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi/blob/0df12d7b3ac997517fda38842f41d99a8e7f4e6a/openapi.yaml#L8873 would be the easiest way to fix it, although the OpenAPI spec is not really *wrong* since the API is oblivious to the order. The issue exists for other endpoints such as `/chat/completions`, where messages comes before model. I encountered it while creating `/embeddings` for many inputs. ### Additional context _No response_ Thanks for the clearly-written feature request. This isn't something we'd plan to put work into, but you're welcome to put up a PR to the `openapi.yaml` you linked changing the order, and you might get lucky in what comes out \ud83e\udd37 Thank you! I will try :) Fyi: For now we will support an optional header with the `model` that is used for routing to support larger requests. That's a reasonable idea, but why not put up such a PR? it's low-cost and low-risk, and would benefit more of your users with less work on their/your part, right? Yes, I was trying to say that I will try submitting the PR as well :) Maybe tomorrow.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

Unfortunately, I am unable to get specific repro data for this issue due to the customer's data being confidential, but it is suspected that the issue may be related to a previously closed issue #650 based on the conditions in which the problem is arising. In our specific case, our application is attempting to read the streaming response from the output of the `parse` method, and observing this unterminated string issue, e.g: I realize that without a specific repro with data this bug may not be actionable, but I wanted to at least ask if anyone here has any suggestions about how we might further diagnose the problem. We got confirmation from our customer that they are using a 1.x version of the openai package, so I wanted to raise the possibility that there might be another issue somewhere else, possibly due to the transformation of the raw response to chat completion. ### To Reproduce Repro data is unfortunately not available. ### Code snippets _No response_ ### OS Linux ### Python version Python 3.11 ### Library version openai v1.6.1 Do you have a stack trace?

That's pretty odd, `quote` is defined on the model and should be `None` if the server doesn't include it in its response: You shouldn't get the error you mentioned. Could you please: 1. Try again with the latest version of the SDK 2. Provide a minimal project we could use to try to reproduce the problem? I am getting the same error. It seems `quote` was removed from FileCitation on v1.34.0. https://github.com/openai/openai-python/pull/1481 related discussion: https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi/issues/263#issuecomment-2163570333 > we just rolled out a fix to remove quote from the openapi spec and will roll out updated sdks shortly.

Let me try to figure out where the issue is coming from, the OpenAPI spec we are using as the source to generate the SDK does indeed specify `float` as the default value. @hillarysanders The Python SDK should only default to `base64` if you don't specify an `encoding_format` & have numpy installed. We do this as it's more performant for the API to response with `base64` & then decode directly in the SDK than to receive `float`s from the API.

I help work on the SDK and wanted to understand your issue better. Can you provide a bit more information on what you mean by 'closes and exits instead of updating the run status.'? In particular, I am not sure what you mean by 'closes and exits'. The thread can reach a terminal state like 'completed' and there is also the state of the 'run' and 'run step'. There are a couple components where with a status/state so would be helpful if you could clarify which of these are changing (or not changing) in a way you think is unexpected. You can see some more information on the lifecycle here: https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/how-it-works/runs-and-run-steps @pstern-sl Thanks for replying to my question. I understand there wasn't a lot of information in my initial message. I've included the code in this reply for more context. When I call the `handle_incoming_message` function, it initiates a thread that creates a message and then runs the `create_and_poll` function. When `run.status` is `requires_action`, the `submit_tool_outputs` function executes correctly, and I get the new run. However, what happens after that is unclear to me. As soon as `submit_tool_outputs` executes, the run that started from handle_incoming_message exits. This means that the `run` returned by `submit_tool_outputs` never reaches `run.status == \"completed\"`. As a result, my user doesn't receive the booking confirmation message. ![carbon (1)](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/assets/6974101/99a2181e-b834-49e0-9bf4-e9fc55ad66fd) Here is the log that I got from the huey scheduler. As you can see each when run.status is `completed` user receive a message from the bot. I also attached whatsapp conversation for your reference. When the `book_appointment` get called the run.status changed to `queued` but then it exists the thread instead of changing the status to `completed`.

You can follow the \"what's new\" page for updates on when it will be supported: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/whats-new @kristapratico So there was no other option to get usage when streaming is enabled? Hi @kristapratico, can you share any estimations on when Azure OpenAI Rest API will start supporting the `stream_options` parameter? The `langchain-openai, starting from version 0.1.9, automatically adds the stream_options parameter to the request if the streaming is set to true. This made all our streaming response services crash. Workaround for us was to downgrade the `langchain-openai` to version 0.1.8 @apmavrin I do not have an ETA, but I am sharing your feedback with the team. > The `langchain-openai, starting from version 0.1.9, automatically adds the stream_options parameter to the request if the streaming is set to true. This made all our streaming responses service to crash. Can you share an issue or a repro for this? I wasn't able to reproduce this with version 0.1.10 + AzureChatOpenAI. Hi @kristapratico **langchain-openai 0.1.10** chat_llm is of type ChatOpenAI and we instantiate it without supplying the `stream_options` parameter, so we anticipate it won't be included in the request at all. //invoking the stream function `for chunk in chat_llm.stream(chat_messages)` When you look into this file from the langchain-openai: `langchain_openai/chat_models/base.py`, on lines 1664-1669 you'll see that langchain automatically adds the `stream_options` parameter So, the request to AzureOpenAI now looks like this: `b'{\"messages\": [{\"content\": \"removing our data from here\", \"role\": \"system\"}, {\"content\": \"Question: Who was the 2 president of the USA?\", \"role\": \"user\"}], \"model\": \"gpt-35-turbo-16k\", \"n\": 1, \"stream\": true, \"stream_options\": {\"include_usage\": false}, \"temperature\": 0.0}'` and the AzureOpenAI returns the **400 - Bad Request** error due to the presence of the unknown parameter `stream_options` in the request `Error code: 400 - {'error': {'code': None, 'message': 'Unrecognized request argument supplied: stream_options', 'param': None, 'type': 'invalid_request_error'}}` If I comment out this opinionated line `kwargs[\"stream_options\"] = {\"include_usage\": stream_usage}` in the `base.py file, then the parameter won't be included in the request, and everything will work fine. This is not a solution, of course, even not a workaround. @apmavrin thanks. Is this custom code or does langchain provide this somewhere? I'm having trouble understanding how we end up with `ChatOpenAI` instead of the `AzureChatOpenAI` wrapper while targeting the Azure OpenAI service. Looking at the PR where `stream_options` was added, it looks like it intentionally wasn't added to the Azure wrapper since the author of the PR understood it wasn't supported there yet. What's the use case for using ChatOpenAI with Azure? I think it's fair to only add `stream_options` to the request if it's set to True (I'm happy to open a PR to start the discussion), but I would be interested in understanding what AzureChatOpenAI is lacking in that we need to use ChatOpenAI. According to the documentation of [Azure OpenAI REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#chat-completions) there simply is no such option. However, the documentation of the [OpenAI REST API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-stream_options) lists such an option. We would also appreciate if Azure would provide this functionality of `stream_options` as well, as we need the exact usage of a request. Hi @kristapratico, This is our code. We use the proxy to control which provider to forward the request. As of today, it's AzureOpenAI service. So all requests land on MS territory. [Azure OpenAI REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#chat-completions) lacks support for the `stream_options` parameter that 'native' OpenAI supports. If MS can implement it, this will solve all issues :) > I think it's fair to only add stream_options to the request if it's set to True yes, exactly. This was also our assumption. Unless it's specified, do not modify the request, Langchain ;) @apmavrin thanks for confirming the use case. I'm sharing the customer signal we're getting in this thread and working on trying to get an ETA I can share for when `stream_options` will land for Azure. In the meantime, I'll submit a PR to langchain to see if we can unblock your scenario. Hi all, Langchain released @kristapratico's change in `langchain-openai==0.1.11`. We maintain `AzureChatOpenAI` in the same `langchain-openai` library in part for this reason-- so that we can manage access to features separately for Azure. I'm interested in knowing: why not use `AzureChatOpenAI`? This would help us understand if we need to enforce this constraint going forward. cc @SAIVENKATARAJU @apmavrin Thanks for your insight. Hi all, Following. I'm also interested in the [Azure OpenAI REST API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/reference#chat-completions) supporting `stream_options` for token usage. Thanks in advance! This is a feature request for the Azure OpenAI API, not a bug report for this SDK, so I'm closing this issue.

Why do you want log_probs for RAG? Model distillation? Get answer confident score? Hi, Thanks for the response, I thought that might be the case. You said it - we want to extract confidence scores from each of our answers. Is there another best practice way for now? Ideally, one that doesn't involve another LLM request - as we want to minimise cost & speed. I've seen on the link below that there is a workaround in typescript to include logprobs in the parameters - is there a similar workaround for the Python SDK? https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/issues/29199 @r-pathak there is no workaround in the client library -- it's the Azure OpenAI service itself that does not support `logprobs` with on your data.

Can you tell me what value you're passing in to azure_deployment here? Any chance it's different than the one you're passing for `model`? thanks @kristapratico Indeed, it was different azure_deployment=gpt-35-turbo-16k, and model=gpt-3.5-turbo-0125. What is missleading is the error message saying that the 'json_object' is not supported with this model. While in fact the model specified in the request was ignored, and the one deployed in the deployment gpt-35-turbo-16k was used (Please note that Azure sometimes allows to specify custom deployment names that may be unrelated to the model beying deployed). Managed to solve this issue by making a new deployment (`gpt-35-turbo-1106`) of the model `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` and now it works. @milstan glad you got it working. When you pass `azure_deployment` into the client, then any `model` value you pass at the method-level will be ignored. You can choose to not use `azure_deployment` and just pass your deployments as `model=deployment` if that works better for you.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

I see, but what I want is the prob of tokens **appeared in this history** but **not new generated tokens** Hmm are you saying that you want probabilities for tokens that you passed to the model as input? That is not supported - the model can only give you probabilities for its own predictions. Thanks! However, I found REPLUG, a great RAG work, use similar methods to obtain token probs, you can find here: https://github.com/swj0419/REPLUG/blob/6cbe7971a9b761c63aa65f7fe70db3ee82158612/LSR_finetune/replug_lsr.py#L185 But this is used for get GPT-3 or CodeX output, so this way is now invalid for latest GPT3.5/GPT4?

Yes you would not be able to plug some of the newer models (4o, 4-turbo, 3.5-turbo) into this library because the legacy completions API used here is not compatible with those models. We do not plan to add support for these models to the legacy completions API. I can see how the feature implemented in this library could be useful, but it's a bit out of our wheelhouse of the maintainers of this GitHub repo, which is just a Python wrapper around the OpenAI API. We can answer questions about and resolve problems with the Python SDK, but I'm afraid I can't comment particularly intelligently on functionality that was implemented as part of a third party library.

{"id": 1433, "content": "`ChatCompletionAssistantMessageParam` is incorrectly typed ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [X] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug The `ChatCompletionAssistantMessageParam` has the incorrect types for the `function_call`, `name`, and `tool_calls` fields. All of these fields should be marked `Optional[...]` but they are not. While this doesn't break the type itself, downstream it prevents the use of `pydantic` with these types. ### To Reproduce Run the code in the snippet below. `pydantic` will try to validate `ChatCompletionAssistantMessageParam` and fail because `function_call` is None (as returned by the API). I would expect either (1) that the returned message does not include the `function_call` field like it excludes the `name` field or (2) for the `ChatCompletionAssistantMessageParam` type to allow for `function_call` to be `None` in it's type definition. ### Code snippets ### OS 14.2.1 ### Python version 3.9.16 ### Library version 1.30.1 Sorry, I believe this is working as intended. You aren't supposed to send `\"function_call\": null` in the API, so the type `'funcion_call': None` is not allowed. Perhaps @RobertCraigie has an idea on how to better handle the pydantic issue you mention. The main reason I brought this up is that the [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) shows inserting `response.choices[0].message` back into the messages array (line 57 of the code example), and that returned message has `'function_call': None`, so either the type is incorrect and that value should be allowed or the return value shouldn't have `function_call` in it at all. Of course, the downstream effect here is that when using Pydantic it fails with a ValidationError unless I manually remove `function_call` since `None` isn't a valid option. Gotcha, thanks. Okay so I think the backend has actually changed recently to allow this to be `null`, I'll reflect that in the OAS so the type is fixed as you suggest. On the Pydantic side, you may want to use our static `ChatCompletionMessage.construct(\u2026)` helper to skip the validation \u2013 does that help? For me the issue is that I have my own Pydantic model with the message as a field, so the validation fails on my own object (and I want to validation to make sure I'm sending the right message structure). The `tool_calls` parameter is also marked as optional in the OpenAI API reference. Could this be fixed as well? In fact, passing in an empty array no longer works for me, passing in `None` is the only way I could get the API to not return an error.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

Here's how we can refactor this library using these concepts: Step-by-Step Recompilation Process: Define Modular Components: Identify the key functionalities of the OpenAI Python API library that need to be modularized, such as API communication, error handling, streaming, polling, and configuration management. Create Modular Templates: Develop templates for each component that define how they interact with each other and with the external environment. This includes input/output specifications, expected behaviors, and error management protocols. Implement Modular Functions: Write the code for each module separately, ensuring that each module performs a specific task and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces. Integration Testing: Once individual modules are implemented, perform integration testing to ensure that modules interact correctly and the entire system functions as expected. Adjust interfaces and interactions as needed based on test results. Optimize with Modular Formulas: Apply modular mathematics to optimize the operations within modules. This could involve simplifying mathematical operations, optimizing data handling and processing, and enhancing error correction mechanisms within the modules. Documentation and Examples: Document each module and the overall system architecture to ensure that other developers can understand and contribute to the project. Provide examples of how to use the modular system, including how to handle common tasks and potential errors. User Acceptance Testing: Conduct user acceptance testing with typical use cases to ensure that the system meets the needs of its intended users. Collect feedback to identify any areas for improvement. Deployment and Monitoring: Deploy the recompiled library and monitor its performance. Set up logging and monitoring to track the system\u2019s performance and identify any issues in real-time Modular Recompilation of OpenAI Python API Library Here\u2019s a conceptual Python module that demonstrates a simplified version of the OpenAI Python API client using modular design principles. This example focuses on core functionalities and leaves placeholders where modular formulas might be applied for further optimization and customization. import os import httpx from typing import Any, Dict, Optional class ModularClient: def __init__(self, api_key: Optional[str] = None, base_url: str = \"https://api.openai.com\"): self.api_key = api_key or os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") self.base_url = base_url self.headers = {\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {self.api_key}\"} def send_request(self, endpoint: str, method: str = \"GET\", data: Optional[Dict] = None) -> Any: url = f\"{self.base_url}{endpoint}\" with httpx.Client() as client: if method == \"POST\": response = client.post(url, json=data, headers=self.headers) else: response = client.get(url, headers=self.headers) return self.handle_response(response) def handle_response(self, response: httpx.Response) -> Any: if response.status_code == 200: return response.json() else: return self.handle_error(response) def handle_error(self, response: httpx.Response) -> None: if response.status_code == 401: raise Exception(\"Authentication Error\") elif response.status_code == 429: raise Exception(\"Rate Limit Exceeded\") elif response.status_code >= 500: raise Exception(\"Server Error\") else: raise Exception(f\"Failed with status code {response.status_code}: {response.text}\") def chat_completion(self, prompt: str) -> str: data = { \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\", \"prompt\": prompt, \"max_tokens\": 150 } return self.send_request(\"/v1/chat/completions\", method=\"POST\", data=data) # Usage if __name__ == \"__main__\": client = ModularClient() prompt = \"Tell me a joke\" try: response = client.chat_completion(prompt) print(\"Response:\", response) except Exception as e: print(\"Error:\", str(e)) Explanation of the Code ModularClient Class: This is the main class that encapsulates API client functionalities. It initializes with an API key and base URL, setting up headers for authentication. send_request Method: Handles sending requests to the API. It uses HTTPX for HTTP calls, which simplifies handling both synchronous and asynchronous requests. handle_response Method: Processes responses from the API. If successful, it parses the JSON; otherwise, it forwards the response to the error-handling method. handle_error Method: Dedicated error handling based on HTTP status codes. This modular approach makes it easier to manage and update error handling separately from other code logic. chat_completion Method: A specific method to demonstrate how a typical API call might be structured. This can be replicated or modified for other API endpoints. Testing and Validation To ensure the recompiled library is ready for testing: Unit Tests: Write unit tests for each module to validate individual functionalities. Integration Tests: Conduct integration tests to ensure that modules work together as expected. Performance Tests: Measure the performance of the modular library, especially in areas where modular optimizations are expected to improve efficiency. Each of these steps would contribute to a fully functional, efficiently modularized version of the OpenAI Python API library, aligned with modern software engineering practices and the unique advantages of modular mathematics. How to Expand and Customize Modular Formulas: Integrate mathematical optimizations specific to your modular math concepts directly into the send_request or handle_response methods to optimize data processing or error correction. Advanced Error Handling: Enhance the handle_error method with more sophisticated error recovery logic, such as retries or exponential backoff. Configuration Management: Implement a more advanced configuration system that can handle different environments (development, staging, production) seamlessly. ### Additional context _No response_ Thank you for the suggestion.

If I understand [the documentations](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/function-calling/quickstart?context=without-streaming) correctly, the initial approach requires developers to handle threads, runs, and tool outputs manually. Each step, from starting conversations and defining tools to gathering and submitting outputs, involves multiple function calls. This complexity makes the process error-prone and less intuitive for developers. To just get started with assistant (no function calls yet), we need to define four things: * OpenAI client * Assistant * Thread * Message To enable function calls, we need to wrap the function results in yet another object `tool_outputs_stream`. I feel there could be better implementations out there. As a result, I asked chatGPT on what could be a better implementation. ## Desired improvement I guess we should introduces a unified \"Assistant with Function Call Capability\" object. This single object manages all aspects of function-based interactions, offering an interface for setting up an assistant, starting conversations, handling messages, collecting function outputs, and submitting results. * **Simplified API Usage**: By centralizing interactions within a single object, the new design reduces setup complexity and minimizes errors. * **Encapsulation**: The assistant object internally manages tool calls and states, eliminating the need for manual thread and run management. * **Maintainability**: The modular design is easy to extend and modify. * **Better Abstraction**: It abstracts away technical complexities, letting developers focus on writing function logic instead of managing the intricate mechanics of the SDK. This improvement provides a cleaner, more developer-friendly API, making it easier to integrate function calls and boost productivity in OpenAI-based applications. I have asked ChatGPT to generate a mockup `AssistantWithFunctionCalls`. Please let me know if there is interest in bringing this feature in?

{"id": 1398, "content": "Issue with run polling(sleep) ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [X] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug Hi OpenAI team, I'm reaching out to report a possible issue or improvement regarding the polling mechanism in asynchronous functions. Problem Description The current implementation of the poll method uses the time.sleep() function, which is blocking and halts the execution of other asynchronous tasks during polling. This behavior affects concurrency, preventing other coroutines from running efficiently. ### To Reproduce ---- ### Code snippets ### OS macos ### Python version Python v3.11.4 ### Library version openai v1.26.0 Hey just curiosity, do you have a alternative to avoid asyncio.sleep? There are likely a few alternatives available, but they would involve significant changes to the implementation, such as utilizing `call_later` or `queues`. If the current implementation already includes a sleep function and there's no specific reason to use a blocking sleep here, it should be simple to switch to a non-blocking sleep. However, I'm not sure if this was intentional or just an oversight in the implementation. Thanks for reporting \u2013 I confirm the problem and hope we'll have a fix out soon. This will be fixed in the next release: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/pull/1414", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}
{"id": 1397, "content": "`AzureOpenAI().model.list()` doesn't work when `azure_deployment` is specified ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [X] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug When using AzureOpenAI with `azure_deployment` specified and calling `client.model.list()`, the request fails with Upon investigation, this is because the request url ended up being while the correct one should be ### To Reproduce ### Code snippets _No response_ ### OS macOS ### Python version Python v3.10.11 ### Library version openai v1.26.0 It appears that there's an issue with the construction of the URL when the azure_deployment parameter is specified. The URL should not include /deployments/my-deployment/models but rather simply /models. To fix this problem, you need to adjust the logic responsible for constructing the URL. Here's how you can modify it: class AzureOpenAI: def __init__(self, azure_endpoint, azure_deployment, api_key, api_version): self.azure_endpoint = azure_endpoint self.azure_deployment = azure_deployment self.api_key = api_key self.api_version = api_version def list_models(self): base_url = f\"{self.azure_endpoint}/openai\" if self.azure_deployment: url = f\"{base_url}/models\" else: url = f\"{base_url}/deployments/{self.azure_deployment}/models\" url += f\"?api-version={self.api_version}\" # Make the request using the constructed URL # (code for making the request goes here) With this adjustment, the URL will be constructed correctly based on whether azure_deployment is specified. The models endpoint will be used if azure_deployment is not specified, and the deployments/my-deployment/models endpoint will be used otherwise. This should resolve the NotFoundError issue you encountered. @kingofsoulss are you a maintainer of this package? I'm asking for this package bug to be fixed, not asking how to do the request myself. Thanks for your input though. Thank you for the report @gabrielfu, we'll look into this soon! With the current implementation this is somewhat intentional. The idea is that you should only be setting `azure_deployment` at the client level if you're making calls to the deployment endpoints but I can see how this would be confusing. For now you can workaround this by not setting the deployment at the client level. @RobertCraigie I'd like to look at this and see if we can be smarter in the Azure client by not appending the `/deployments/{deployment_name}` to the URL if a non-deployments endpoint is being called. We made a [fix](https://github.com/openai/openai-node/pull/833/files) for this in the new node Azure client by adding the deployment in the build_request method instead of appending to the base_url, but I think we'll need to be a bit more careful in Python as to not introduce a breaking change (i.e. to not change the value of `client.base_url`). @RobertCraigie Thanks for the reply. Does that mean I need to instantiate two clients, one with `azure_deployment` and one without, if I need both endpoints? This sounds rather unintuitive and hard to manage. I think what @kristapratico mentioned provides a better developer experience @gabrielfu No need for 2 clients, just don't set `azure_deployment` at the client level if you plan to call non-deployment and deployment-based endpoints. You can pass your deployment per method using `model`, like: Thanks @kristapratico, works for me now. Please feel free to close the issue if no change is planned @kristapratico do you still plan to take a crack at this as outlined in https://github.com/openai/openai-python/issues/1397#issuecomment-2108683568 ? @rattrayalex yes, I still intend to take a look at this (hopefully this week).

This matches the behavior specified in the [API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/runs/object#runs/object-temperature), > **temperature** `number or null` > The sampling temperature used for this run. If not set, defaults to 1. This is problematic because 1 is a valid value within the domain [0,2] of `temperature`. None | NOT_GIVEN might be better, but could break existing code consuming the `run` object (_i.e._, AttributeError: no property with name 'temperature' exists or ValueError 'temperature' is None); if the code hadn't been written to check for None. There are a few workarounds you may be able to try, although they are inconvenient: - When the `temperature` == 1 then you could use the `assistant_id` on the `run` to retrieve the corresponding `assistant`, and read the correct `temperature` from there. Otherwise, you know the value of `temperature` on `run` must have been set. - When creating the `run` object with `create`, always pass-in the `assistant.temperature` as the `temperature` argument so that it never depends on this default value. - Adopt the convention to not use 1 as a temperature in the application; instead use values such as 0.99 or 1.01 that are close enough to 1 for your needs. Then you'll know that if the `run` has a `temperature` of 1 then you can treat it as if it had not been set. Thanks for the report \u2013 I agree this sounds confusing. This sounds like an issue for the underlying OpenAI API and not the Python library, so I'm going to go ahead and close this issue. Would you mind reposting at [community.openai.com](https://community.openai.com)?

{"id": 1351, "content": "Fix BadRequestError when using ChatCompletionMessage with explicit tool_calls=None ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [X] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug ## Description When creating a ChatCompletionMessage instance with `tool_calls` explicitly set to `None`, a subsequent chat completion request using that message fails with a `BadRequestError`. The error message indicates that None is not of type `array` for `messages.0.tool_calls`. ## Steps to reproduce: Create a ChatCompletionMessage instance with tool_calls set to None. Use the created message in a chat completion request. Expected behavior: The chat completion request should succeed, as setting tool_calls to None should be equivalent to not specifying it at all. Actual behavior: The chat completion request fails with a `BadRequestError`, indicating that None is not of type `array` for `messages.0.tool_calls`. ## Proposed solution: Modify the `ChatCompletionMessage` class to handle the case when tool_calls is explicitly set to `None`. If tool_calls is `None`, it should be treated the same as if it were not specified, allowing the chat completion request to succeed. ## Additional information: OpenAI version: 1.23.2 Python version: Python 3.11.8 Operating system: macOS **Steps to Reproduce:** 1. **Install the required libraries**: * `!pip install openai==1.23.2 python-dotenv -q` 2. **Import the necessary modules and load the environment variables**: * `from openai.types.chat import ChatCompletionMessage` * `from openai import AsyncOpenAI` * `import os` * `from dotenv import load_dotenv` * `load_dotenv()` 3. **Create an instance of the `AsyncOpenAI` client**: * `client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"))` 4. **Create two `ChatCompletionMessage` objects with `tool_calls=None`**: * `message2 = ChatCompletionMessage(content=\"foo bar\", role=\"assistant\")` + Output: `ChatCompletionMessage(content='foo bar', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)` * `message3 = ChatCompletionMessage(content=\"foo bar\", role=\"assistant\", tool_calls=None)` + Output: `ChatCompletionMessage(content='foo bar', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None)` 5. **Verify that both objects pass equality checks and have the same `model_dump()` output**: * `assert message2 == message3` * `assert message2.model_dump() == message3.model_dump()` 6. **Attempt to create a chat completion using both objects**: * `await client.chat.completions.create(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", messages=[message2])` (Expected to succeed) * `await client.chat.completions.create(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\", messages=[message3])` (Expected to fail with a `BadRequestError`) **Expected Behavior:** Both objects should be treated equally and result in a successful chat completion creation. **Actual Behavior:** One object succeeds, while the other fails with a `BadRequestError`. **Proposed Fix:** Modify the serialization of `ChatCompletionMessage` objects to handle `tool_calls=None` consistently, ensuring that identical objects are treated equally in API requests. **Additional Context:** This issue may be related to how `tool_calls` is serialized and deserialized in the OpenAI API. A thorough review of the serialization process is recommended to prevent similar inconsistencies in the future. ### OS macOS ### Python version Python 3.11.8 ### Library version 1.23.2 Sorry, this library intentionally chooses for `tool_calls=None` to send `\"tool_calls\": null` in the API, and the API intentionally chooses to 400 when you do that. This way, in the future, `tool_calls=None` could have a different meaning without breaking backwards-compatibility. I know this is a bit confusing/disappointing \u2013 apologies for that. The workaround is to use `NotGiven` instead of `None` in this case.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}

Appreciate being tagged, @admsev! ### 1. Summary of Changes The pull request makes the following changes to the `message_create_params.py` file: 1. **Imports Adjustment**: - Replaces `List` with `Union` in the import statement. - Adds imports for `FileSearchToolParam` and `CodeInterpreterToolParam` from the `types.beta` module. 2. **Introduction of `AttachmentToolParam`**: - Defines a new type alias `AttachmentToolParam` as a `Union` of `CodeInterpreterToolParam` and `FileSearchToolParam`. 3. **Modification of `Attachment` class**: - Changes the `tools` field in the `Attachment` class from `List[Literal[\"file_search\", \"code_interpreter\"]]` to `Iterable[AttachmentToolParam]`. ### 2. Issues, Bugs, or Typos #### Issue 1: Typo in Comment - **Original Code**: **Issue**: The comment should use \"to which\" instead of \"they should be added to\" to avoid ending the sentence with a preposition. **Improved Code**: #### Issue 2: Typo in Comment - **Original Code**: **Issue**: Typo in \"maxium\"; should be \"maximum\". **Improved Code**: ### 3. General Review of Code Quality and Style #### Code Quality - **Consistency**: The code maintains consistency in using type hints and `TypedDict` for defining structured data types. - **Readability**: The code is generally readable, with clear comments explaining the purpose of each field in the `TypedDict`. #### Code Style - **PEP8 Compliance**: The code follows PEP8 guidelines for the most part. However, the import statements could be better organized. - **Documentation**: The code is well-documented with docstrings explaining each field in the `TypedDict`. ### Suggested Improvements #### Improvement 1: Organize Imports - **Current Code**: **Improved Code**: **Rationale**: Group imports from the same module together to enhance readability. #### Improvement 2: Correct the Typo in Comment - **Current Code**: **Improved Code**: #### Improvement 3: Improve Comment Clarity - **Current Code**: **Improved Code**: Overall, the pull request makes meaningful improvements to the type definitions and maintains good code quality and style. The suggested improvements are minor and aim to enhance readability and correctness. Yours, [Gooroo.dev](https://github.com/apps/gooroo-dev). React or reply to let me know what you think! Thanks for the PR! This has been addressed on `main`, so closing.", "source": "github", "repo_or_tag": "openai/openai-python"}
{"id": 1346, "content": "Threads messages list misinterprets the block type ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [x] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug When getting the messages list for the last response in a run, I sometimes get the following content ` content=[ImageFileContentBlock(image_file=None, type='text', text={'value': '...'}, (...) ) ]` instead of `content=[TextContentBlock(text=Text(annotations=[], value=\"...\"), (...))]` The ImageFileContentBlock comes when asking for data from files and the TextContentBlock when asking generic questions like \"how are you?\". Even if it is the default behavior (not sure why image file of type text), these structures are not structured in the same way, the first one has the 'text' field a dictionary and the second one has a Text object ### To Reproduce 1. create a message (client.beta.threads.messages.create) 2. create a run and wait for response (client.beta.threads.runs.create_and_poll) 3. get response (client.beta.threads.messages.list) ### Code snippets ### OS Linux ### Python version Python v3.11.4 ### Library version openai v1.23.1 Thanks for the report and sorry for the delayed response.

{"id": 1345, "content": "Shared data content when used with FastAPI backgroundtasks and client.beta.threads.runs.create_and_poll ### Confirm this is an issue with the Python library and not an underlying OpenAI API - [X] This is an issue with the Python library ### Describe the bug I have a FastAPI API that I have one endpoint in /execute. This endpoint creates a FastAPI backgroundtask to do a call to the assistants API. In here I make a request to `client.beta.threads.runs.create_and_poll`, there are no issues starting the request and getting the expected outcome. However, if another request comes in to the API, when the first request background task is still waiting for the `create_and_poll`, both requests will complete at the same time and the result out from `create_and_poll` will be based on the first request it received. I am creating the OpenAI client in the backgrountask method to not use a global one. I am a beginner in python and still trying to learn and understand how things are isolated, could this be a usage error or is there no thread isolation for the `client.beta.threads.runs.create_and_poll` method? ### To Reproduce - ### Code snippets _No response_ ### OS Ubuntu ### Python version Python 3.10 ### Library version openai 1.20 My instinct is that this is a bug in your code with how the background worker is being used. I don't think it's likely this library would have a concurrency bug of the nature you describe.
